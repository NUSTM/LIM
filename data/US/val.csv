"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following is Management’s Discussion and Analysis of the Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) of Professional Holding Corp. (“the Company”) for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related footnotes of our Company presented in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. In addition to historical information, this
discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from management’s expectations. Factors that could cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those described in the section titled “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information.”
Overview
Net income for Professional Holding Corp. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) for the year ended December 31, 2020, was $8.3 million ($0.67 per diluted common share) compared to $2.3 million ($0.40 per diluted common share) for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing a 255.5% increase in net income and a 67.5% increase in earnings per diluted common share. The results from 2020 included closing our initial public offering, completion of the acquisition and integration of Marquis Bancorp Inc. (“MBI”) and expanding our market share despite a worldwide pandemic.
Highlights of our performance and financial condition as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 and other key events that occurred during 2020 are provided below.
Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2020
● Net income of $8.3 million, an increase of $6.0 million, or 255.5%, compared to the same period in 2019.
● Net interest income of $60.1 million, an increase of $32.0 million, or 114.1%, compared to the same period in 2019.
● Noninterest income totaled $4.3 million, an increase of $1.5 million, or 53.3%, compared to the same period in 2019.
● Noninterest expense of $43.6 million, an increase of $16.6 million, or 61.6%, compared to the same period in 2019. MBI business combination expenses and additional full-time employees were primarily responsible for the increase.

Financial Condition
At December 31, 2020:
● Total assets grew to $2.1 billion, an increase of $1.0 billion, or 95.3%, compared to December 31, 2019 due to the MBI business combination, our participation in the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), with some of these loans match funded with PPPLF advances of $101.4 million, and new organic growth. At December 31, 2020, the Company had a gross PPP loan balance of $190.0 million.
● Net loans grew to $1.6 billion, an increase of $0.9 billion, or 109.5%, compared to December 31, 2019. We experienced growth across all loan types due to new organic originations (including PPP) of $0.6 billion, acquisitions of $0.5 billion, offset by net paybacks and advances of approximately $0.3 billion, for the year ended December 31, 2020.
● Nonperforming assets totaled $10.4 million, an increase of $8.1 million, or 357.6%, compared to $2.3 million at December 31, 2019. As part of our continued evaluation of a credit where the borrower, Coex Coffee International Inc. (“Coex”) petitioned the court for an Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors, the Company classified the full loan amount of $8.3 million as substandard non-accrual as of December 31, 2020.
● The Company maintained its strong capital position. As of December 31, 2020, the Company was well-capitalized, with a total risk-based capital ratio of 14.7%, a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 12.9%, a common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 12.9%, and a leverage ratio of 10.0%. As of December 31, 2020, and 2019, all of
our regulatory capital ratios exceeded the thresholds to be well-capitalized under the applicable bank regulatory requirements.
● The Company recorded adjustments to the original fair value estimates of the MBI valuation in the fourth quarter.
Other Highlights
● In February 2020, we announced the closing of our initial public offering of 3,565,000 shares of Class A Common Stock, which included an additional 465,000 shares in connection with the exercise in full of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares
● In March 2020, we closed on our acquisition of MBI and its wholly owned subsidiary, Marquis Bank.
● In June 2020, we successfully completed our systems conversion of MBI.
● In November 2020, we opened our new loan production office in Bedford, NH to service our new search fund lending business.
● We participated in the PPP and processed/closed/funded 1,506 small business loans representing $226.2 million in relief proceeds throughout 2020.
Acquisition of MBI
On March 26, 2020, we closed our acquisition with MBI and its wholly owned subsidiary, Marquis Bank, headquartered in Coral Gables, Florida. This acquisition resulted in the growth of the balance sheet, net interest income, and non-interest income and expense from the prior year. The Company identified $539.9 million of acquired loans with a book balance, prior to fair value adjustments. An initial fair value adjustment of $19.3 million was recorded through goodwill. Measurement period adjustments related to other fair value factors totaled $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and will amortize through interest income over the remaining life of each loan. The acquisition has already provided increased credit portfolio diversity and increased lending capacity and accelerated our growth strategy and profitability targets.
COVID-19 Operational Response and Bank Preparedness
The outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID-19, which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, has led to adverse impacts on the global economy and created uncertainty in the world’s financial markets.
The Company continues to work within the COVID-19 pandemic response plans which were originally established in the Spring of 2020. The Company continues to update these plans to ensure that they comply with the latest governmental guidelines and health conditions. As conditions permit, these plans facilitate our staff judiciously and safely returning to the office. On December 31, 2020, approximately 35% of our staff was working in the office while approximately 65% was working by remote access. This compares to July 10, 2020, when 20% of our staff was working in the office and 80% was working by remote access.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic we have:
● The Company participated in the PPP and processed/closed/funded 1,506 small business loans representing $226.2 million in relief proceeds throughout 2020. The majority of these loans were initially pledged to the Federal Reserve as part of the PPPLF. The PPPLF pledged loans are non-recourse to the Company. In addition, we paid off approximately $123.6 million in PPPLF advances during the year ended December 31, 2020 and had a balance of $101.4 million remaining as of December 31, 2020.
● The Company added an online PPP application form and automated the PPP loan closing documentation process.
● As of December 31, 2020, we have reviewed and processed numerous debt service relief requests in accordance with Section 4013 of the CARES Act and interagency guidelines published by federal banking regulators on March 13, 2020. As currently interpreted by the agencies, the guidelines assert that short-term modifications made on good faith for reasons related to the COVID-19 pandemic to borrowers who were current prior to such relief are not considered Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs). These modifications include deferrals of principal and interest, modification to interest only, and deferrals to escrow requirements. The modifications have varying terms up to six months.
● During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company approved $199.8 million in payment relief modifications that were granted under the CARES Act guidance associated with the treatment of TDRs. Since the inception of the CARES Act, $187.8 million of these loans either have been reinstated to their original payment terms or have been paid off. As of December 31, 2020, there were 13 loans measured with a fair value of $11.1 million, that remain under the exemption from TDR classification as provided for in the CARES Act.
● To manage credit risk, the Company increased oversight and analysis of loans to borrowers in vulnerable industries, such as hotels and hospitality. As of December 31, 2020, these loans have a balance of $54.3 million. For the year ended December 31, 2020, $30.6 million of these loans were provided payment relief consistent with Section 4013 of the CARES Act and the interagency guidelines published on March 13, 2020, and as of December 31, 2020, $28.3 million has been reinstated and returned to normal payment schedules, with one deferred loan remaining in this group.
The economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have significantly impacted and continue to significantly impact business and economic activity in the United States and around the world. There have been full and partial business closures, increases in unemployment as workers are furloughed, laid off, or had hours limited. Such disruptions could adversely affect our loan and deposit fee income as well as create downward pressure on the quality of our loan portfolio possibly leading to an increase in loan charge-offs.
The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented event that has created high levels of uncertainty. We are vigilantly monitoring global events and actions being taken by various Federal and State Agencies. We have maintained interim periodic communications with our regulators and have not experienced any material deposit outflows to date and frequently communicate with our credit clients.
Given the fluidity of the situation, management cannot predict the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company for 2021 or beyond.
Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Net Income
The following table sets forth the principal components of net income for the periods indicated.
Net income for the year ended December 31, 2020, was $8.3 million, an increase of $6.0 million, or 255.5%, from net income for the year ended December 31, 2019, of $2.3 million. Interest income increased $29.9 million while interest expense decreased $2.1 million, resulting in a net interest income increase of $32.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in our interest income was primarily due to an increase in interest earning assets, primarily from the MBI business combination, our participation in the SBA’s PPP, with some of these loans match funded with PPPLF advances of $101.4 million. Provision for loan losses increased by $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a specific reserve of $7.6 million recorded to address the impairment of the loans made to one of its borrowers, Coex Coffee International Inc. (“Coex”) (See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Coex Coffee International Inc.”). Noninterest income increased $1.5 million and noninterest expense increased $16.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily a result of the MBI business combination expenses as well as increases in occupancy and equipment expense due to the opening of two new bank branches and the digital innovation center and increases in professional services expense due to costs related to building the organizational infrastructure of a publicly traded company.
Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin Analysis
We analyze our ability to maximize income generated from interest earning assets and control the interest expenses of our liabilities, measured as net interest income, through our net interest margin and net interest spread. Net interest income is the difference between the interest and fees earned on interest earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings, which are used to fund those assets. Net interest margin is a ratio calculated as annualized net interest income divided by average interest earning assets for the same period. Net interest spread is the difference between average interest rates earned on interest earning assets and average interest rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities.
Changes in market interest rates and the interest rates we earn on interest earning assets or pay on interest-bearing liabilities, as well as in the volume and types of interest earning assets, interest bearing and noninterest-bearing liabilities and shareholders’ equity, are usually the largest drivers of periodic changes in net interest income, net interest margin and net interest spread. Fluctuations in market interest rates are driven by many factors, including governmental monetary policies, inflation, deflation, macroeconomic developments, changes in unemployment rates, the money supply, political and international conditions and conditions in domestic and foreign financial markets. Periodic changes in the volume and types of loans in our loan portfolio are affected by, among other factors, the economic and competitive conditions in the Miami-Dade MSA, as well as developments affecting the real estate, technology, government services, hospitality and tourism and financial services sectors within the Miami-Dade MSA. Our ability to respond to changes in these factors by using effective asset-liability management techniques is critical to maintaining the stability of our net interest income and net interest margin as our primary sources of earnings.
The following table shows the average outstanding balance of each principal category of our assets, liabilities and shareholders’ equity, together with the average yields on our assets and the average costs of our liabilities for the periods
indicated. Such yields and costs are calculated by dividing the annualized income or expense by the average daily balances of the corresponding assets or liabilities for the same period.
(1) Includes nonaccrual loans.
(2) Net interest spread is the difference between interest rates earned on interest earning assets and interest rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities.
(3) Net interest margin is a ratio of net interest income to average interest earning assets for the same period.
(4) Interest income on loans includes loan fees of $4.4 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The following table presents information regarding the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for the periods indicated for each major component of interest earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and distinguishes between the changes attributable to changes in volume and changes attributable to changes in interest rates. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume that cannot be segregated have been proportionately allocated to both volume and rate.
Net interest income increased by $32.0 million to $60.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Our total interest income was impacted by an increase in interest earning assets, primarily due to the MBI business combination, our participation in the SBA’s PPP, with some of these loans match funded with PPPLF advances of $101.4 million, and new organic growth. Average total interest earning assets were $1.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared with $0.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. The annualized yield on those interest earning assets decreased 64 basis points from 4.67% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 4.03% for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the reductions in the federal funds target interest rates by the Federal Reserve as well as loans repricing, coupled with higher yielding loan payoffs. Our yield on interest earning assets declined during the year ended December 31, 2020, which was partially offset by lower interest expense on our interest-bearing deposits and earnings credits accumulated during the year of $26.5 thousand. The increase in the average balance of interest earning assets was driven primarily by growth in our loan portfolio of $0.9 billion, representing an increase of 109.5%, to $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $0.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Average interest-bearing liabilities increased by $0.6 billion, or 90.0%, from $0.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $0.4 billion, or 70.4%, increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits. The increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits was primarily due to increases in certificates of deposit and money market accounts for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to for the year ended December 31, 2019, and, to a lesser extent, negotiable order of withdrawal accounts, or NOW accounts. The annualized average interest rate paid on average interest-bearing liabilities decreased to 0.76% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 1.78% for the year ended December 31, 2019, while the annualized average interest rate paid on interest-bearing deposits decreased 105 basis points to 0.68% and the annualized average interest rate paid on borrowed funds increased by 120 basis points to 1.11%. The decreases in annualized average interest rates primarily reflected a decrease in market interest rates due to decreases in the federal funds target interest rate during the year ended December 31, 2020. For year ended December 31, 2020, our average other noninterest-bearing liabilities increased $1.2 million, or 6.8%, to $17.7 million from $16.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. Average noninterest-bearing deposits also increased $245.4 million, or 148.8%, from $165.0 million to $410.4 million for the same periods. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our annual net interest margin was 3.50% and net interest spread was 3.27%. For the year ended December 31, 2019, annual net interest margin was 3.34% and net interest spread was 2.90%. Our net interest margin was adversely affected by 0.16% during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, as a result of the recent reductions in the federal funds target interest rates as well as continued declines in the 10-year treasury yield, average rates earned on
interest earning assets and average rates paid on our interest-bearing deposits generally declined during the year ended December 31, 2020. Correspondingly new loans were priced at lower yields in comparison to previously held loans which led to numerous loan payoffs at the beginning of 2020 compared to 2019.
Provision for Loan Losses
The provision for loan losses is a charge to income in order to bring our allowance for loan losses to a level deemed appropriate by management. For a description of the factors taken into account by our management in determining the allowance for loan losses see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Allowance for Loan Losses.”
Our provision for loan losses amounted to $10.0 million for 2020 and $0.9 million for 2019. The increase from 2019 to 2020 was primarily due to a specific reserve of $7.6 million recorded to address the impairment of the Coex loan, the growth of our loan portfolio and the anticipated decline in worldwide economic activity due the actual and projected effects of COVID-19. Our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans, net of overdrafts and excluding PPP loans was 1.10% and 0.83% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively (non-GAAP, see Explanation of Certain Unaudited Non-GAAP Financial Measures). The increase was primarily due to the Company addressing the impairment of the Coex loan in the third quarter of 2020. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Coex Coffee International Inc.” We recorded three net charge-offs for $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. We did not record any net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, MBI purchase accounting loan marks were $18.8 million.
Noninterest Income
Our primary sources of recurring noninterest income are service charges on deposit accounts, income from Bank owned life insurance, origination fees for Small Business Administration, or SBA loans, swap referral fees and other fees and charges. Noninterest income does not include loan origination fees to the extent they exceed the direct loan origination costs, which are generally recognized over the life of the related loan as an adjustment to yield using the interest method. The following table presents the major categories of noninterest income for the periods indicated.
Noninterest income for 2020 was $4.3 million, a $1.5 million or 53.3% increase compared to noninterest income of $2.8 million for 2019. The increase was primarily due an increase in deposit accounts service charges, of $0.9 million, or 338.1%, during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019 due to deposit growth. We also experienced an increase in revenue from loans held for sale of $0.5 million, or 166.7% during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019.
Noninterest Expense
Generally, noninterest expense is composed of all employee expenses and costs associated with operating our facilities, obtaining and retaining client relationships and providing banking services. The largest component of noninterest expense is salaries and employee benefits. Noninterest expense also includes operational expenses, such as occupancy and equipment expenses, professional fees, acquisition expenses, data processing expenses, advertising
expenses, loan processing expenses and other general and administrative expenses, including FDIC assessments, communications, travel, meals, training, supplies and postage. The following table presents the major categories of noninterest expense for the periods indicated.
Noninterest expense amounted to $43.6 million in 2020, an increase of $16.6 million, or 61.6%, compared to $27.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to the MBI business combination expenses as well as an increase in salaries and benefits from increased employee headcount, increases in occupancy and equipment expense due to the opening of two new bank branches and the digital innovation center, increases in professional services expense due to costs related to building the organizational infrastructure of a publicly traded company and a charitable contribution of $0.3 million to the AAA Scholarship Foundation.
Income Tax Expense
The amount of income tax expense we incur is influenced by the amounts of our pre-tax income, and other nondeductible expenses. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at current income tax rates in effect for the period in which the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, such as the Tax Act, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
Income tax expense was $2.4 million for 2020 and $0.7 million for 2019. Our effective tax rates for 2020 and 2019 were 22.5% and 21.9%, respectively.
Financial Condition
Our total assets grew to $2.1 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $1.0 billion, or 95.3%, compared to December 31, 2019 as a result of the MBI acquisition, our participation in the SBA’s PPP, with some of these loans match funded with PPPLF advances of $101.4 million, and new organic growth. At December 31, 2020, the Company had a gross PPP loan balance of $190.0 million. Net loans grew across all loan types due to new organic originations (including PPP) of $0.6 billion, acquisitions of $0.5 billion, offset by net paybacks and advances of approximately $0.3 billion, resulting in total net loan gowth of $0.9 billion, or 109.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2020. Interest-bearing deposits increased $0.5 billion, or 67.1%, during the year ended December 31, 2020, due to the acquisition as well as organic growth which provided us with additional capital to fund our growing loan pipeline. Shareholders’ equity increased $136.3 million, or 171.8%, to $215.6 million at December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019, primarily due to the acquisition of MBI and the closing of our IPO. Net income resulted in an increase to retained earnings of $8.3 million as of December 31, 2020.
Interest-Bearing Deposits at Other Financial Institutions
Cash that is not immediately needed to fund loans by the Bank is invested in liquid assets that also earn interest, including deposits with other financial institutions. For the year ended December 31, 2020, interest-bearing deposits at other financial institutions decreased $21.3 million, or 14.1%, to $129.3 million from $150.6 million at December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to our desire to increase our investment portfolio by purchasing securities with higher returns.
Investment Securities
We use our securities portfolio to provide a secondary source of liquidity, achieve additional interest income through higher yields on funds invested (compared to other options, such as interest-bearing deposits at other banks or fed funds sold), manage interest rate risk, and meet both collateral and regulatory capital requirements.
Securities may be classified as either trading, held-to-maturity or available-for-sale. Trading securities (if any) are held principally for resale and recorded at their fair value with changes in fair value included in income. Held-to-maturity securities are those which the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity and are reported at amortized cost. Equity securities are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in net income. Equity securities without readily determinable fair values are carried at cost, minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment. Available-for-sale securities consist of securities not classified as trading securities nor as held-to maturity securities. Unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are excluded from income and reported in comprehensive income or loss. Gains and losses on the sale of available-for-sale securities are recorded on the trade date and are determined using the specific-identification method. Premiums and discounts on securities available for sale are recognized in interest income using the interest method over the period to maturity.
Our investment portfolio increased by $65.5 million, or 220.9%, to $95.1 million at December 31, 2020, from $29.6 million at December 31, 2019. The investment of a portion of the proceeds from the Company’s initial public offering and MBI acquisition are the primary reason for this increase. The Company invested these proceeds into liquid assets to fund loan growth, as well as securities available for sale. To supplement interest income earned on the Company’s loan portfolio, the Company invests in high quality mortgage-backed securities, government agency bonds, corporate bonds, community development district bonds, and equity securities (including mutual funds).
The following tables summarize the contractual maturities and weighted-average yields of investment securities as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 and the amortized cost and carrying value of those securities as of the indicated dates.
Loan Portfolio
Our primary source of income is derived from interest earned on loans. Our loan portfolio consists of loans secured by real estate as well as commercial business loans, construction and development and other consumer loans. Our loan clients primarily consist of small to medium sized businesses, the owners and operators of these businesses as well as other professionals and entrepreneurs. Our owner-occupied and investment commercial real estate loans, residential construction loans and commercial business loans provide us with higher risk-adjusted returns, shorter maturities and more sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations, and are complemented by our relatively lower risk residential real estate loans to individuals. Our lending activities are principally directed to our market area consisting of the Miami-Dade
MSA. The following table summarizes and provides additional information about certain segments of our loan portfolio as of the dates indicated.
Commercial Real Estate Loans. We originate both owner-occupied and non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans. These loans may be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. Commercial real estate loans that are secured by owner-occupied commercial real estate and primarily collateralized by operating cash flows are also included in this category of loans. As of December 31, 2020, we had $287.0 million of owner-occupied commercial real estate loans and $490.8 million of investment commercial real estate loans, representing 36.9% and 63.1%, respectively, of our commercial real estate portfolio. As of December 31, 2020, the average loan balance of loans in our commercial real estate loan portfolio was approximately $1.2 million for owner-occupied and $1.6 million for non-owner-occupied. Commercial real estate loan terms are generally extended for 10 years or less and amortize generally over 25 years or less. Terms of 15 years are permitted where the loan is fully amortized over the term of the loan. The maximum loan to value is generally, 80% of the market value or purchase price, but may be as high as 90% for SBA 504 owner-occupied loans. Our credit policy also usually requires a minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.20x. As of December 31, 2020, our weighted-average loan-to-value ratios for owner-occupied and non-owner-occupied commercial real estate were 46.9% and 50.8%, respectively and debt service coverage ratios were 2.33x and 1.74x, respectively. The interest rates on our commercial real estate loans have initial fixed rate terms that adjust typically at five years and we routinely charge an origination fee for our services. We generally require personal guarantees from the principal owners of the business, supported by a review of the principal owners’ personal financial statements and global debt service obligations. All commercial real estate loans with an outstanding balance of $1.0 million or more are reviewed at least annually. The properties securing the portfolio are located primarily
throughout our market and are generally diverse in terms of type. This diversity helps reduce the exposure to adverse economic events that affect any single industry.
As of December 31, 2020, non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans of $490.8 million represented 33.5% of total risk-weighted assets.
Construction and Development Loans. The majority of our construction loans are offered within the Miami-Dade MSA to builders primarily for the construction of single-family homes and condominium and townhouse conversions or renovations and, to a lesser extent, to individuals. Our construction loans typically have terms of 12 to 18 months with the goal of transitioning the borrowers to permanent financing or re-underwriting and selling into the secondary market. According to our credit policy, the loan to value ratio may not exceed the lesser of 80% of the appraised value, as established by an independent appraisal, or 85% of costs for residential construction and 90% of costs for SBA 504 loans.

The Company's financial statements currently present financial information for two industry segments in which the Company does business: (a) processing technologies and related activities and (b) packaging materials. Information relating to sales by the Company or its subsidiaries of fresh-cut corn and potatoes and the provision of scientific and technical services is included in the financial information presented for the processing technologies and related activities segment.
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999
Sales. Sales decreased from $30,307,000 in 1999 to $27,814,000 in 2000, a decrease of $2,493,000 or 8.2%. Sales of processing technologies and related activities decreased from $7,539,000 in 1999 to $4,408,000 in 2000, a decrease of $3,131,000 or 41%. Sales of U.S. packaging materials increased from $2,666,000 in 1999 to $3,204,000 in 2000, an increase of $538,000 or 20%. Sales of U.K. packaging materials increased from $11,486,000 in 1999 to $14,194,000 in 2000, an increase of $2,708,000 or 24%. Sales of European packaging materials decreased from $8,616,000 in 1999 to $6,008,000 in 2000, a decrease of $2,608,000 or 30%.
The decrease in sales of processing technologies and related activities was mainly due to the lower sales revenue from fresh-cut corn sold through the Company's majority-owned affiliate, Newcorn, which accounted for 89% of the decline. During 1999 and early 2000 the Company restructured the corn operations and withdrew from the market. This withdrawl also involved not only a reduction in overheads, thus reducing the breakeven level of sales, but also a complete reappraisal of the sales and purchasing model. In addition, the Company largely withdrew from the corn market during November and December 2000. Given the previous experience of the business, the Company did not previously contract for corn growing during this period in order to maintain a favorable risk profile. At the end of 2000, the management decided that it was appropriate to discontinue its corn operations under its previous format, which had consumed much of the Company's financial and management resources. The management agreement with the Company's
partner in Newcorn had come to an end, which made it a suitable point for the Company to refocus its resources on those opportunities that offer higher margins and a shorter, less demanding route to market. As a result of this, the Company has agreed with Green Giant to discontinue the use of the brand for corn and with them pursue a different entry into the market that places little, if any, demands on the Company's resources. The Company's strategic objectives remain undiminished in terms of the provision of processing technologies and the Company believes that it will be able to supply technology to the corn industry, without incurring the capital expenditures and expenses required to manufacture and distribute corn products using such technology. This withdrawal from the day to day activity of supplying finished corn product will help facilitate the Company's move to profitability, which remains the Company's goal. However, there can be no assurance that such will be the case.
During the first quarter of 2000, the Company completed the relocation of its potato processing equipment from Somis, California to Pasco, Washington. The production and shipment of fresh-cut potato products commenced in March from the Pasco, Washington facility of Reser's. During this relocation period the Company withdrew a number of products from the market and thus, there was a fall in revenue while the processing line was relocated. These products were put back into production during the second and third quarters of 2000. This transition has taken longer than expected and the Company is only just getting back into production after several distribution tests and studies. This relocation followed the signing in October 1999 of a strategic five-year manufacturing and co-pack agreement with Reser's, under which Reser's will process and supply EPL Food with all of EPL Food's fresh-cut potato product requirements. As stated earlier, this relocation caused some disruption to shipments and also caused the Company to restrict its sales and marketing activities until such time as the relocation was completed, which accounted for the balance of the decline in this segment.
In addition to the above mentioned co-pack agreement, Reser's will process and supply EPL Food with a new range of blanched (partially cooked) potato products to be sold by EPL Food under the Fresh Alternatives (TM) brand. The Fresh Alternatives (TM) brand has been made available to EPL Food by the Sholl Group II, Inc., the exclusive licensee of The Pillsbury Company's Green Giant (R) Fresh brand name. The Company has already commenced sales of these blanched potato products, although such sales did not have a material impact on sales revenue during 2000. In addition, the Company and Reser's agreed to enter into a related five-year non-exclusive license agreement for the Company's proprietary processing technology for potatoes. The Company currently believes these arrangements for both fresh and blanched potato products will have a material positive impact on the sales revenue of EPL Food in 2001 and beyond, although there can be no assurance such will be the case.
During the first quarter of 2000, the Company announced an exclusive licensing arrangement with Monterey Mushrooms for its Mushroom Fresh (R) processing technology, and began generating revenue during the second and third quarters of 2000. During the last few months, the Company has been discussing the nature of its relationship with Penn State University. These discussions were precipitated by Penn State's claim that the Company had breached certain of its obligations under the License (a claim the Company believes is without merit). However, the Company has agreed to consider Penn State's proposal to terminate the license and enter into a new non-exclusive license covering the same technology, which modified license the Company believes will not have a material adverse effect on its ability to penetrate the fresh mushroom market. As of the date hereof, no final decision with Penn State has been reached. In addition, during December the license granted to Monterey Mushrooms was changed to become non-exclusive. Although such revenue is currently not material, the Company believes that these arrangements will have a material contribution to processing technology revenue in 2001 and beyond, although there can be no assurance that this will in fact be the case. The Company is also following up on potential opportunities for processing technologies and scientific and technical services in Europe.
In line with the Company's stated objective of achieving group profitability, and as its Pure Produce subsidiary was forecasting continued losses, it was agreed with the management of this subsidiary that it
would be more appropriate for it to function outside of the Company. Thus, subsequent to the year end, certain assets of the subsidiary were sold at approximately net book value to management. Total proceeds were not material to the Company.
The 20% increase in U.S. packaging material sales was principally attributable to increasing sales of perforated products, as well as timing differences in shipments to large customers compared to the same period of 1999. In May 2000 the Company signed a two year manufacturing and supply agreement with Procter & Gamble to provide a key component for a new consumer product. This component, to be manufactured at a U.S. facility of the Company's U.S. packaging business, involves the use of proprietary technology. The product and its expected volume have not been identified for competitive reasons. The U.S. packaging facility has been expanded to better manage the increased volume and production demands of this new agreement. The Company continues to be engaged in discussions with a number of potential customers for new product applications and markets, especially in relation to the Company's proprietary perforating capabilities. These products are marketed for use in pharmaceutical, bakery, snackfood, consumer goods, healthcare, confectionery and industrial markets Some initial orders have been received to date. Should further such orders be forthcoming, the Company expects that such new orders would make a material contribution to sales revenue in 2001 and onwards. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will obtain these orders The 24% increase in U.K. packaging material sales was principally attributable to an increase in the sales of packaging to the produce industry. The Company is now one of the leading suppliers of produce packaging to processors supplying most of the main food retailers in the U.K., and this market segment now represents the largest single segment of the U.K. business. The Company believes that its efforts to change product mix represent a more stable foundation for sustainable and more profitable growth, although there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in these efforts. The year 2000 has seen a full year's benefit of some of the increased orders, which is expected to generate a material increase in revenue during 2001 and beyond, although there can be no assurance that such additional revenue will be obtained. In addition, the Company's proprietary micro-perforating technology has enabled the Company to win new orders in the area of cooked meat pastry products and the Company believes it is the market leader in this industry segment. New orders continue to be gained in the area of ""breathable"" packaging and the Company has increased its production capacity in this area to handle the forecast volume increase. During the first quarter of 2000, the U.K. operation installed an 8 color press to further enhance its tactical abilities. Other applications are currently under development, which, if successful, could have a material impact on sales revenues in 2001 and beyond, although there can be no assurance that this development will result in new orders. The 30% decline in sales of European packaging materials was due mainly to (i) an adverse movement in exchange rates when converting sales into US dollars, which moved approximately 15% in 2000 as compared with the same period of 1999 and (ii) the impact of flood damage that occurred at the Fabbri factory in late October. It is anticipated that adverse currency conversion rates are expected at least in the short term to affect Spanish sales as reported in US dollars as compared to the prior year period. The flood damage restricted Fabbri's sales revenues in the final two months of 2000. With a delay in the receipt of insurance proceeds, and with limited availaility of capital, this restriction on sales revenue has continued into 2001 and is expected to adversely impact Fabbri's sales revenues at least through the first half of 2001. Once these issues have been resolved, Fabbri will look to integrate its activities more with the U.K. subsidiary, not only to leverage its scientific and technical knowledge base, but also to be able to offer customers a pan European service offering. This will also take advantage of the U.K.'s expertise in perforating.
Gross Profit. Gross profit increased from $108,000 in 1999 to $2,394,000 in 2000, an increase of $2,286,000 or, as a percentage of sales, from 0.4% to 8.6%. Following management's decision to exit its corn operations (see Note 3 to the Company's consolidated financial statements), a one time write down of
$235,000 of inventory at Newcorn was made to reduce the inventory to its estimated market value. Without this charge, the gross profit would have been 9.5%, despite incurring operational losses within the corn business during the year The reported increase reflected the considerably reduced losses in the corn operations, following the restructuring that occurred at the end of 1999. In addition, there was also a significant improvement in the results of the potato operations, following the completion at the end of the first quarter of the relocation of the potato processing facility to Reser's Pasco, Washington facility. The gross margin in the US packaging business also improved, as a result of improved volumes and a more beneficial sales mix. There was also a further gain in the UK packaging margin, reflecting significant volume increases, resulting in improved economies of scale, as well as a continuing improvement in product mix. These gains were offset by a fall in the gross profit in European packaging, caused principally by the lower sales volumes, as well as additional impact of the floods which limited revenue generation, but where costs continue to be incurred. These costs have not yet been reimbursed under business interruption claims (see Note 13 to the Company's consolidated financial statements).
In addition, the Company continues to accelerate the development of certain applications for its proprietary micro-perforating technology. These costs are primarily expensed as incurred. Although the benefits of this expense have started to contribute to incremental sales revenue and gross profits, it is expected to increase significantly in the U.K. and other areas moves forward with various projects, although there can be no assurance that such will be the case.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased from $9,898,000 in 1999 to $9,316,000 in 2000, a decrease of $582,000 or 6%. This decrease was despite incurring (i) over $377,000 of non-cash charges relating to the amortization of the fair value of warrants issued, (ii) the continuing and accelerating development of the Company's sales and marketing efforts, particularly in the area of packaging and perforation development, and (iii) other costs, including additional professional fees. The Company's sales and marketing efforts with respect to processing technologies and related activities are primarily focused on fresh-cut potatoes, apples and mushrooms, together with packaging and perforation applications. This decrease in expenses also reflects the change in the nature of development costs incurred, as some products move from the product development stage to market development. This is evidenced by a significant fall in research and development costs as outlined below.
Research and Development Costs. Research and development costs decreased from $1,870,000 in 1999 to $1,341,000 in 2000, a decrease of $529,000 or 28%. The reduction reflects the reallocation of resources from development to application and execution. The Company continues to expense all development costs, whether product, market or sales related, as incurred, and thus costs are incurred prior to the benefits, if any, that may be expected to be realized from such expense. The Company expects that research and development costs will continue at no less than recent levels and may increase.
Gain on sale of fixed assets. As noted in the Company's consolidated financial statements, in 1999 the Company completed a sale and leaseback of the land and building at its Spanish trading subsidiary, Fabbri, with an unrelated third party. The Company raised gross proceeds, before costs and taxes, of PTS800,000,000 (approximately $5,100,000). The Company expects to realize a total pretax profit of approximately $2,303,000 on this transaction. For financial reporting purposes, $374,000 (1999:$285,000) of this total profit has been recognized in the year 2000. The remaining balance will be recognized over the eight year life of the associated leaseback. The tax on this profit can be deferred for up to 10 years under Spanish tax rules.
Restructuring Costs. As explained more fully in Note 3 to the Company's consolidated financial statements, management took the decision to cease the operations of Newcorn and to exit the fresh corn products market. As a result, a charge was made for various exit costs of $947,000, including rent, salary and utilities through the estimated date the related facilities would be closed or leased. In addition, further impairment provisions were made against inventory (recorded within cost of sales), goodwill and fixed assets (recorded within depreciation and amortization).
Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased from $2,141,000 in 1999 to $5,218,000 in 2000, an increase of $3,077,000 or 144%. Of this increase, $348,000 related to the write down of goodwill and $2,747,000 to the writedown to fixed assets, both in relation to the Company's corn business, following the decision to discontinue corn operations in its previous format (See Note 3 to the Company's consolidated financial statements). Excluding these one time items, depreciation and amortization would have decreased by $18,000 (0.8%) to $2,123,000.
Loss from Operations. Loss from operations increased from $13,517,000 in 1999 to $14,054,000 in 2000, an increase of $537,000 or 4%. Of the total, $4,277,000 related to various one time charges related to the closure of its fresh cut corn operations. Excluding these charges, loss from operations would have decreased from $13,517,000 in 1999 to $9,777,000 in 2000, a decrease of $3,740,000, after incurring operational losses incurred in the corn business. The decrease in the loss was primarily due to the significant improvement in gross margins, despite the lower sales revenue and the impact of the floods in Spain. In addition, there was a net reduction in total operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization and the amortization of the fair value of the warrants mentioned above, of over $1,427,000. Further improvements are expected in this regard, and management believes that the infrastructure costs can be further leveraged as sales continue to develop. However, because all development costs are expensed as they are incurred, together with the fact that such expense is necessarily incurred before the benefits of increased sales and improved margins can be seen, the Company's financial results do not yet reflect this activity.
Interest Expense. The increase in interest charges from the charge of $820,000 in 1999 to $10,135,000 in 2000 principally reflects the non-cash cost amortization of deferred finance costs incurred in 1999, together with additional finance charges arising from the additional shares of Common Stock granted upon the restructuring of the facility with the Lenders as described in Note 7 to the Company's consolidated financial statements. In addition, there is a fair value provision for warrants granted in the first quarter of 2000 in connection with the first quarter financing described in Note 7 to the Company's consolidated financial statements. Of the total charge in the current year of $10,135,000, $8,966,000 (88%) represents the aforementioned non-cash costs. In addition, the level of debt for the year ended December 31, 2000 was considerably higher than the same period in 1999.
Accretion, Discount and Dividends on Preferred Stock. Accretion, discount and dividends on Preferred Stock increased from $1,203,000 in 1999 to $1,548,000 in 2000, an increase of $345,000. This non-cash increase was due to an adjustment reflecting the fair value of warrants issued during the year 2000, which totaled $1,508,000 (97%) of the total charge in the period. Most of the expense in 1999 related to a fair value charge for warrants granted in connection with the conversion of the remaining Series D Stock in 1999, plus an appreciation provision on the Series D Stock, all of which Stock was converted by December 31, 1999.
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998
Sales. Sales decreased from $32,978,000 in 1998 to $30,307,000 in 1999, a decrease of $2,671,000 or 8.1%. Sales of processing technologies and related activities decreased from $8,913,000 in 1999 to $7,539,000 in 1999, a decrease of $1,374,000 or 15.4%. Sales of U.S. packaging materials decreased from $3,318,000 in 1998 to $2,666,000 in 1999, a decrease of $652,000 or 20%. Sales of U.K. packaging materials fell from $11,929,000 in 1998 to $11,486,000 in 1999, a decrease of $443,000 or 3.7%. Sales of European packaging materials decreased marginally from $8,818,000 in 1998 to $8,616,000 in 1999, a decrease of $202,000 or 2.2%.
The decrease in sales of processing technologies and related activities was mainly due to the lower sales revenue from fresh-cut corn sold through the Company's majority-owned affiliate, Newcorn. During the second quarter of 1999 the Company completed the work on its facility in Darien, Wisconsin (the ""Darien Facility""). However, this was just prior to the short period of the year when local corn is generally available. The Company decided not to incur significant ongoing costs to compete against low value corn at uneconomic prices and thus limited its sales activities, principally during the third quarter but which also adversely impacted the fourth quarter. During this market withdrawl in the fourth quarter, the Company restructured Newcorn. This withdrawl involved not only a reduction in overheads, thus reducing the breakeven level of sales, but also a complete reappraisal of the sales model. The Company has identified the need for changes in the way it promotes its corn to major customers, to help support the year round model, and has been implementing such changes accordingly. In addition, the Company is focusing its sales efforts on food service, as well as to develop its traditional retail market. In relation to this market extension, the Company is also extending the range of corn products available, and plans to introduce further new products during 2000 onwards. During part of the year, Newcorn had at times been unable to process and sell on a profitable basis bulk corn that it had committed to purchase. This situation impacted gross profit and since then, the Company has limited its corn commitments under contract.
Offsetting the decrease in corn revenue described above, the Company experienced significant growth in the volume of fresh-cut potato products sold by its EPL Food Products, Inc. (""EPL Food"") subsidiary under the ""Green Giant(R) Fresh"" brand name. The Company has continued to expand both the geographical coverage of its sales effort and the product range, and now offers a number of different fresh-cut potato products in addition to its original ""Fresh Fries"". However, as the Company continued to seek to expand its product range and geographic coverage, the Company sought to find a strategic partner to help in this process. As mentioned above, in October 1999 the Company announced that it had signed a strategic five-year manufacturing and co-pack agreement with Reser's Fine Foods, Inc. (""Reser's""). Under the agreement, Reser's will process and supply EPL Food with all of EPL Food's fresh-cut potato product requirements. Subsequent to the year end, the Company completed the relocation of its potato processing equipment and production and shipment of fresh-cut potato products commenced from Reser's Pasco, Washington facility.
In addition, Reser's will process and supply EPL Food with a new range of blanched (partially cooked) potato products to be sold by EPL Food under the Fresh Alternatives (TM) brand. The Fresh Alternatives (TM) brand has been made available to EPL Food by the Sholl Group II, Inc., the exclusive licensee of The Pillsbury Company's Green Giant (R) Fresh brand name. The Company has already commenced sales of these blanched potato products, although such sales did not have a material impact on sales revenue in 1999. In addition, the Company and Reser's agreed to enter into a related five-year non-exclusive license agreement for the Company's proprietary processing technology for potatoes. The Company currently believes these arrangements for both fresh and blanched potato products will have a material positive impact on the sales
revenue of EPL Food in 2000 and beyond, although there can be no assurance such will be the case.
The Company is continuing to focus on the sale and development of its processing technologies, particularly with respect to corn, potatoes and apples. Furthermore, development work continues to seek to exploit the new technologies for use on freshly harvested mushrooms and whole peeled potatoes. In this regard, subsequent to the year end, the Company announced an exclusive licensing arrangement with Monterey Mushrooms for its Mushroom Fresh (R) processing technology. The Company currently believes that these arrangements will have a material contribution to processing technology revenue in 2000 and beyond, although there can be no assurance that this will in fact be the case. In addition, product testing continues on other vegetables, and in some cases has been expanded or accelerated, and significant costs have been incurred to date that are yet to yield material revenues. The Company also continues to grow its capability in scientific and technical services, opening a new West Coast laboratory in 1999, and is seeing an increasing demand for food safety and hygiene advice in the produce industry. Revenue from this area rose by 34% over the same period in 1998 and the Company expects further increases in this figure in 2000 and beyond, although there can be no assurance such will be the case. The Company believes it is well-positioned to add further value to the operations of fresh-cut processors. Furthermore, the Company is receiving an increasing number of inquiries for its processing technologies from potential U.K. and European customers.
The reduction in U.S. packaging material sales was principally attributable to timing differences in shipments to large customers compared to the same period of 1998 and the Company currently expects to recover some of this volume going forward, in addition to what was recovered in the fourth quarter. The Company is currently engaged in discussions with a number of potential customers for new product applications and markets, especially in relation to the Company's proprietary perforating capabilities, leveraging the knowledge base of the U.K. operations. These include applications in the consumer goods, produce, horticultural, bakery and pharmaceutical industries, amongst others. Some initial orders have been received in 2000. Should further such orders be forthcoming, the Company expects that such new business would make a material contribution to sales revenue in 2000 and onwards. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will in fact obtain this business. As noted above, as part of the Company's desire to better exploit its perforation technologies in the U.S., the Company and ANC have agreed to unwind their joint venture and are discussing various alternative relationships going forward.
The small decrease in U.K. packaging material sales was principally attributable to a reduced level of sales to Pepsico, historically the Company's largest single customer, as well as the adverse impact of pricing pressures in the U.K., together with a reduction in sales of film to the bakery industry. The impact, however, was offset by increased sales in other areas, as the Company continued the execution of its strategic objective to reduce its dependence on Pepsico and the bakery industry, both of which are lower margin areas of activity, and focus more effort on utilizing its proprietary perforating technology to move into new, higher value-added areas. This strategy began to have an impact in the final quarter of 1999, as evidenced by the fact that sales revenue in the fourth quarter of 1999 was 32% higher than in same period in 1998. Raw material prices have generally fallen by some 10-15% compared with the same period in 1998, which accounts for most of the reduction in revenue, as sales prices were adjusted downwards to reflect the lower raw material prices. The Company believes that its efforts to change product mix represents a more stable foundation for sustainable and more profitable growth, although there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in these efforts. During 1998 the Company's Respire(R) brand of breathable packaging for fresh produce was launched in the U.K. and has been successful in gaining new business in 1999. In this regard, the Company has recently gained new business from the suppliers to the main supermarkets in the U.K., and these began to come through in increased shipments, as indicated by the revenue increase in the
fourth quarter of 1999. The year 2000 is expected to see a full year benefit of the increased new business, which is expected to generate a material increase in revenue during 2000 and beyond, although there can be no assurance that such additional revenue will be obtained. In addition, the Company's proprietary micro-perforating technology has enabled the Company to win new business in the area of cooked meat pastry products, although the volume of this business has not been significant to date. New business continues to be gained in the area of ""breathable"" packaging and the Company has recently increased its production capacity in this area to handle the forecast volume increase. Other applications are currently under development, which, if successful, could have a material impact on sales revenues in 2000, although there can be no assurance that this development will result in new business.
Sales of European packaging materials decreased marginally, principally as a result of timing differences in shipments. The 1999 citrus harvest was delayed slightly, resulting in some shipments of packaging materials being delayed. The Company, through Fabbri, is targeting further expansion not only in Spain but in other European countries and this is beginning to show results. In addition, Fabbri is reducing its dependency on the citrus crop by increasing its sales of packaging materials used in fresh produce and other areas. Fabbri is also seeking to expand its limited revenue derived from South American countries through existing and new contacts. Furthermore, Fabbri is working increasingly closely with the U.K. business not only to leverage the scientific and technical knowledge base, but to be able to offer customers a pan-European service offering. In support of this, a new sales office was opened in France in late 1999, where Fabbri already generates significant sales revenue, and a further sales office is expected to open in the second quarter of 2000 in Amsterdam, Netherlands. These are expected to contribute to sales revenue in 2000 and beyond, although there can be no assurance that this will in fact be the case. The increased technical base is reflected in the la",0
"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion, particularly information with respect to our future results of operations or financial condition, business strategy and plans and objectives of management for future operations, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties as described under the heading “Forward-Looking Statements” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. You should review the disclosure under the heading “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to utilizing our proprietary gene engineering platform technologies to create next generation cell and gene therapeutics with the capacity to cure. We have discovered and are developing a broad portfolio of product candidates in a variety of indications based on our core proprietary platform, including our non-viral piggyBac DNA Delivery System, Cas-CLOVER Site-Specific Gene Editing System and nanoparticle- and AAV-based gene delivery technologies. Our core platform technologies have utility, either alone or in combination, across many cell and gene therapeutic modalities and enable us to engineer our wholly-owned portfolio of product candidates that are designed to overcome the primary limitations of current generation cell and gene therapeutics.
Within cell therapy, we believe our technologies allow us to create product candidates with engineered cells that engraft in the patient’s body and drive lasting durable responses that may have the capacity to result in single treatment cures. Our CAR-T therapy portfolio consists of both autologous and allogeneic, or off-the-shelf, product candidates. We are advancing a broad pipeline with a plan to have multiple CAR-T product candidates in the clinic in 2021 in both hematological and solid tumor oncology indications. Within gene therapy, we believe our technologies have the potential to create next generation therapies that can deliver long-term, stable gene expression that does not diminish over time and that may have the capacity to result in single treatment cures. The following table summarizes our current product candidate portfolio:
We were incorporated in December 2014 and subsequently spun out from Transposagen, a company that has been developing gene engineering technologies since 2003. Since our inception, our operations have focused on organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, in-licensing, developing and acquiring intellectual property rights and establishing and protecting our intellectual property portfolio, developing our gene engineering technologies, identifying potential product candidates and undertaking research and development and manufacturing activities, including preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates, and engaging in
strategic transactions. We do not have any product candidates approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. We have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity. Since our inception, we have raised an aggregate of $334.3 million of gross proceeds from the sale of shares of our redeemable convertible preferred stock, received $30.0 million of gross proceeds from borrowings under our loan agreement and received an aggregate of $23.8 million in grant funding from the California Institute of Regenerative Medicine, or CIRM. On July 14, 2020, we completed our IPO pursuant to which we issued and sold 14,000,000 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $224.0 million. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $309.2 million. Since our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses and expect to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future. Our net losses were $129.8 million and $86.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $281.9 million.
We expect our expenses and losses to increase substantially for the foreseeable future as we continue our development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates, including P-BCMA-101 and P-PSMA-101, and begin to commercialize any approved products, as well as hire additional personnel, pay for accounting, audit, legal, regulatory and consulting services, and pay costs associated with maintaining compliance with Nasdaq listing rules and SEC requirements, director and officer insurance, investor and public relations activities and other expenses associated with operating as a public company. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending on the timing of our clinical trials and our expenditures on other research and development activities.
We do not expect to generate any revenues from product sales unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval for P-BCMA-101, P-PSMA-101, or any other product candidates, which will not be for at least the next several years, if ever. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. Accordingly, until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our operations through equity offerings, debt financings or other capital sources, including potentially grants, collaborations, licenses or other similar arrangements. However, we may not be able to secure additional financing or enter into such other arrangements in a timely manner or on favorable terms, if at all. Especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we can give no assurances that we will be able to secure such additional sources of funds to support our operations, or, if such funds are available to us, that such additional financing will be sufficient to meet our needs. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and could force us to delay, reduce or terminate our research and development programs or other operations, or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.
The manufacturing process for our allogeneic product candidates is nearly identical to the process for our autologous product candidates, except for the gene editing and related steps. We work with a number of third-party contract manufacturers for production of our product candidates. We also work with a variety of suppliers to provide our manufacturing raw materials including media, DNA and RNA components. We have completed construction of an internal pilot GMP manufacturing facility in San Diego adjacent to our headquarters to develop and manufacture preclinical materials and clinical supplies of our product candidates for Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials in the future. We commenced operations in this facility in the second half of 2020, but we expect that we will continue to rely on third parties for various manufacturing needs. In the future, we may also build one or more commercial manufacturing facilities for any approved product candidates.
License Agreements
Below is a summary of the key terms for certain of our license agreements. For a more detailed description of these and our other license agreements, see the section titled “Business-License Agreements” and Note 10 to our annual consolidated financial statements.

We are also obligated to pay, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, tiered royalties in the low to mid-single-digit percentage on net sales of any Genus licensed products and related companion diagnostics. The royalty rate is subject to reduction upon certain events.
Acquisition of Vindico
On October 10, 2016, we completed the acquisition of all the outstanding ownership interests in Vindico NanoBiotechnology, Inc., or Vindico, a company with expertise in polymer-based nanoparticle technology for delivery of, for example, gene therapy technologies. We paid $1.1 million in cash and issued an aggregate of 350,522 shares of common stock to the selling shareholders. The common stock was valued at $0.7 million based on the fair value of our common stock at October 10, 2016 or $1.88 per share. We paid additional cash consideration of $0.6 million in 2017.
In connection with the Vindico acquisition, we agreed to pay additional purchase consideration, based on the achievement of a certain developmental milestone using the acquired technology by October 2018, payable in shares of our common stock. In July 2018, we amended the terms of the Vindico merger agreement, which included an extension of contingency period through July 2019, the calculation to determine the number of shares to be settled and an option to settle the contingency in cash under certain circumstances. In July 2019, the developmental milestone was met and pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we subsequently issued 866,125 shares of common stock, valued at $10.6 million to the former Vindico shareholders in August 2019. There is no further consideration due related to the Vindico acquisition.
CIRM Grant Funding
In December 2017, we were granted an award in the amount of $19.8 million from CIRM to support our clinical trial for P-BCMA-101. The terms of the award include an option to repay the grant or convert it to a royalty obligation upon commercialization of the program. Based upon the terms of the agreement, we will record proceeds as a liability when received. As of December 31, 2020, proceeds received from the grant totaled $19.7 million. We may receive up to $0.1 million in future milestone payments.
In September 2018, we were granted an additional award in the amount of $4.0 million from CIRM to support our preclinical studies for P-PSMA-101. As of December 31, 2020, all $4.0 million had been received and no additional future payments were remaining.
Components of Our Results of Operations
Operating Expenses
Research and Development
Research and development expenses consist primarily of external and internal costs incurred for our research and development activities, including development of our platform technologies, our drug discovery efforts and the development of our product candidates.
External costs include:
•
expenses incurred in connection with the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates and research programs, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants, contractors and contract research organizations;
•
the cost of developing and scaling our manufacturing process and manufacturing drug products for use in our preclinical studies and clinical trials, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants, contractors and contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs;
•
payments made under third-party licensing agreements; and
•
laboratory supplies and research materials.
Internal costs include:
•
personnel-related expenses, consisting of employee salaries, related benefits and stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development functions;
•
facilities, depreciation and other expenses, consisting of direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and insurance; and
•
any impairment of indefinite-lived in process research and development, or IPR&D, related assets.
We expense research and development costs as incurred. External expenses are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information provided to us by our service providers or our estimate of the level of service that has been performed at each reporting date. Upfront payments and milestone payments made for the licensing of technology are expensed as research and development in the period in which they are incurred. Advance payments that we make for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses or other long-term assets. These amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed.
At any one time, we are working on multiple research programs. We track external costs by the stage of program, clinical or preclinical. Our internal resources, employees and infrastructure are not directly tied to any one program and are typically deployed across multiple programs. As such, we do not track internal costs on a specific program basis.
Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to CRO activity and manufacturing expenses. We expect that our research and development expenses will increase substantially in connection with our planned preclinical and clinical development activities in the near term and in the future, including in connection with our ongoing Phase 1 exploratory trial and Phase 2 trial of P-BCMA-101 for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma and Phase 1 trial of P-PSMA-101 for the treatment of patients with mCRPC. At this time, we cannot accurately estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the preclinical and clinical development of any of our product candidates. Our development costs may vary significantly based on factors such as:
•
the number and scope of preclinical and IND-enabling studies;
•
per patient trial costs;
•
the number of trials required for approval;
•
the number of sites included in the trials;
•
the countries in which the trials are conducted;
•
the length of time required to enroll eligible patients;
•
the number of patients that participate in the trials;
•
the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients;
•
potential additional safety monitoring requested by regulatory agencies;
•
the duration of patient participation in the trials and follow-up;
•
the cost and timing of manufacturing our product candidates;
•
the phase of development of our product candidates;
•
the efficacy and safety profile of our product candidates;
•
the extent to which we establish additional licensing agreements; and
•
whether we choose to partner any of our product candidates and the terms of such partnership.
A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our product candidates could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. We may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. We may obtain unexpected results from our clinical trials and preclinical studies.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include direct and allocated facility-related costs as well as professional fees for legal, patent, consulting, investor and public relations, accounting and audit services. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support our continued research activities and development of our product candidates, including P-BCMA-101 and P-PSMA-101, and begin to commercialize any approved products. We also anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase as a result of payments for accounting, audit, legal, regulatory and consulting services, as well as costs associated with maintaining compliance with Nasdaq listing rules and SEC requirements, director and officer insurance, investor and public relations activities and other expenses associated with operating as a public company.
Increase (Decrease) in Contingent Consideration
In connection with our acquisition of Vindico in October 2016, we agreed to pay additional consideration based on the achievement of a certain developmental milestone using the acquired technology. The additional purchase consideration was payable in shares of our common stock. The number of shares of common stock issuable and the associated fair value could vary depending on (1) the price paid by investors in a qualified equity financing prior to the achievement of the milestone and (2) when and if the milestone is reached. We classified this contingent consideration as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets that was remeasured to fair value at each reporting date, and we recognized changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability as a component of operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. We recognized changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability until the milestone was met in July 2019. Upon issuance of the common stock related to the milestone in July 2019, the liability was reclassified to stockholder’s deficit, within additional paid-in capital. For additional detail, see the subsections titled “-Acquisition of Vindico” above.
Other Income (Expense)
Interest Expense
Interest expense consists of (1) interest expense on outstanding borrowings under our loan agreement and (2) amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net consists of (1) interest income and (2) miscellaneous income and expense unrelated to our core operations.
Interest income is comprised of interest earned on our invested cash balances in short-term investments. We expect our interest income to decrease based on available market interest rates.
Miscellaneous income and expense unrelated to our core operations is comprised of changes in fair value of warrant liability. We issued warrants to purchase shares of our Series A-1 preferred stock in connection with our loan agreement in July 2017. We issued additional warrants to purchase shares of our Series B preferred stock in connection with the amendment of our loan agreement in August 2018 and in February 2019. We classified these warrants as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets that we remeasured to fair value at each reporting date, and we recognized changes in the fair value of the warrant liability as a component of other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. We continued to recognize changes in the fair value of the warrant liability until the warrants qualified for equity classification. Upon the closing of the IPO, the preferred stock warrants became exercisable for common stock instead of preferred stock and the fair value of the warrant liability at the date of the IPO was reclassified to additional paid-in-capital. For additional detail, see the subsection titled “-Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates-Valuation of Warrants to Purchase Preferred Stock” below and Note 5 to our annual consolidated financial statements.
Results of Operations
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):
Research and Development Expenses
The following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):
(1)
Clinical stage programs include costs related to P-BCMA-101 for the year ending December 31, 2019 and costs related to P-BCMA-101 and P-PSMA-101 for the year ending December 31, 2020.
Research and development expenses were $103.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $60.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in research and development expenses of $43.1 million was primarily due to increases in the following: $15.5 million of personnel expenses related to increased headcount, $13.6 million of external costs related to our clinical stage programs including the ongoing enrollment and manufacturing for the P-BCMA-101 Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trial and initiation of the Phase 1 P-PSMA-101 trial, $9.6 million of external costs related to our preclinical programs, and $4.4 million of internal costs related to facilities and other expenses.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses were $23.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $18.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in general and administrative expenses of $4.5 million was primarily due to an increase of $5.9 million of personnel expenses related to increased headcount and an decrease of $1.4 million of professional fees, largely due to the financing costs expensed in 2019 related to the IPO work completed prior to closing a private round of financing, offset by higher costs incurred in 2020 related to being a public company.
Increase in Contingent Consideration
Our contingent consideration liability relates to the Vindico acquisition, in which we had a contingent obligation to issue shares of our common stock to former Vindico shareholders upon achievement of a proof of concept preclinical milestone. Increase in contingent consideration was $0 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. In the 2019 period, we recorded an increase in our contingent consideration liability resulting from the successful completion of the milestone in July 2019. Upon issuance of the common stock related to the milestone in July 2019, the liability was reclassified to stockholder’s deficit, within additional paid-in capital.
Interest Expense
Interest expense was $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Interest expense consisted of interest on the outstanding principal under our loan and security agreement, which was consistent during the respective periods.
Other Income, Net
Other income was $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to other income of $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease in other income of $2.3 million was primarily due to $0.7 million of interest income partially offset by a $0.4 million increase in warrant liability during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $2.0 million of interest income and a $0.5 million decrease of warrant liability during the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in interest income was driven by a decrease in available interest rates for investments.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We were incorporated in December 2014 and subsequently spun out from Transposagen, a company that has been developing gene engineering technologies since 2003. Since our inception in 2014, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net losses were $129.8 million and $86.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $281.9 million. Our operations have focused on organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, in-licensing and acquiring intellectual property rights and establishing and protecting our intellectual property portfolio, developing our gene engineering technologies, identifying potential product candidates and undertaking research and development and manufacturing activities, including preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates,
and engaging in strategic transactions. Our primary use of cash is to fund operating expenses, which consist primarily of research and development expenditures, and to a lesser extent, general and administrative expenditures. Cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of when we pay these expenses, as reflected in the change in our outstanding accounts payable and accrued expenses. We have not yet commercialized any of our product candidates and we do not expect to generate revenue from sales of any product candidates for several years, if at all. We have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity. Since our inception, we have raised $224.0 million of gross proceeds from the sale of our common stock in our IPO, raised an aggregate of $334.3 million of gross proceeds from the sale of shares of our redeemable convertible preferred stock, received $30.0 million of gross proceeds from borrowings under our loan agreement and received an aggregate of $23.8 million in grant funding from CIRM. We expect that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2020 of $309.2 million will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months from the date of issuance of the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the long term we will need additional financing to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy.
Loan Agreement
In July 2017, we entered into a loan and security agreement, or 2017 Loan Agreement, with Oxford. Under the original terms, the facility provided $15.0 million, of which we drew $10.0 million. In August 2018, we entered into an amended and restated agreement with Oxford, or the 2018 Loan Agreement, to, among other things, increase the size of the facility to $30.0 million, modify the interest rate and extend the interest-only payment period and the maturity date. In addition, we concurrently increased the outstanding principal by $10.0 million.
As of August 2018, outstanding borrowings under the 2018 Loan Agreement consisted of a Term A loan, in the amount of $20.0 million.
In February 2019, we drew the remaining available balance under the 2018 Loan Agreement, or Term B loan, in the amount of $10.0 million. The Term A loan and Term B loan (together “Term Loans”) bear interest at a floating per annum rate equal to (1) 6.94% plus (2) the greater of (a) the 30 day U.S. Dollar LIBOR rate reported in The Wall Street Journal on the last business day of the month that immediately precedes the month in which the interest will accrue and (b) 2.00%. As of December 31, 2020, the interest rate applicable to our Term Loans borrowing was 8.9%.
We will be required to make a final payment of 7.5% of the principal balance outstanding, payable on the earlier of (1) the maturity date, (2) acceleration of any Term Loan or (3) the prepayment of the Term Loans.
In June 2020, we entered into a fourth amendment to the 2018 Loan Agreement with Oxford to extend the interest-only payment period and maturity date. All outstanding Term Loans will no",0

Please also see the section entitled ""Forward-Looking Statements.""
Business Overview
We are a value-oriented food retailer serving a diverse and dynamic demographic of household and business customers through two complementary store banners. Our Smart & Final stores focus on both household and business customers, and our Smart Foodservice stores focus primarily on business customers. As of December 30, 2018, we operated 326 convenient, non-membership, smaller-box, warehouse-style stores throughout the Western United States, with an additional 15 stores in Northwestern Mexico operated through a joint venture. We have a differentiated merchandising
strategy that emphasizes high quality perishables, a wide selection of private label products, products tailored to business and foodservice customers and products offered in a broad range of product sizes, all at ""everyday low prices.""
As of December 30, 2018, we operated 260 Smart & Final stores in California, Arizona and Nevada, which offer extensive selections of fresh perishables and everyday grocery items, together with a targeted selection of foodservice, packaging and janitorial products, under both national and private label brands. Customers can choose from a broad range of product sizes, including an assortment of standard-sized products typically found at conventional grocers, and a large selection of larger sized offerings (including uniquely sized national brand products) more typical of warehouse club style stores. Pricing in our Smart & Final stores is targeted to be substantially lower than that of conventional grocers and competitive with that of large discount store operators and warehouse clubs. We believe we offer higher quality produce at lower prices than typically found at large discounters. We also believe our Smart & Final stores provide a better everyday value to household and business customers than typical warehouse clubs by offering greater product selection at competitive prices, with no membership fee requirement, in a convenient, easy-to-shop format.
Within the Smart & Final banner we operate both Extra! and legacy Smart & Final stores. Beginning in late 2008, we launched an initiative to convert our larger legacy Smart & Final stores to our Extra! format. With a larger store footprint and an expanded merchandise selection, our Extra! format offers a one-stop shopping experience with over 16,000 SKUs, over 4,000 more SKUs than our legacy Smart & Final stores, with an emphasis on perishables and household items. As of December 30, 2018, we operated 201 Extra! stores of which 105 represent conversions or relocations of legacy Smart & Final stores and 96 represent new store openings. In recent years we have significantly increased the number of Extra! stores, facilitated primarily by our acquisition of a dedicated perishables warehouse, our acquisition of a group of stores in fiscal year 2016, and by our continued investments in distribution capabilities and in-store merchandising. The continued development of our Extra! store format, through additional new store openings and expansions and relocations of legacy Smart & Final stores to the Extra! store format, is expected to be the cornerstone of future Smart & Final banner growth.
As of December 30, 2018, we also operated 66 Smart Foodservice stores focused primarily on restaurants, caterers and a wide range of other foodservice businesses such as food trucks and coffee houses. We offer customers the opportunity to shop for their everyday foodservice needs in a convenient, no-frills warehouse shopping environment. These stores are located in Washington, Oregon, Northern California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada and Utah. Pricing in our Smart Foodservice stores is targeted to be substantially lower than that of our foodservice delivery competitors, with greater price transparency to customers and no minimum order size. Pricing is also competitive with typical warehouse clubs, with no membership fee requirement. Since late 2014, we have opened 14 new Smart Foodservice stores in existing and new market areas, and are actively pursuing additional growth opportunities for this store banner.
In both store banners, we are actively investing in increasing online sales, including both direct delivery to customers through partner services and using buy online, pick up-in-store models. As of December 30, 2018, we offered direct delivery or pick up-in-store options across nearly our entire geographic footprint and fulfil these orders in over 98% of our Smart & Final stores and Smart Foodservice stores.
We believe that our ""everyday low prices,"" unique merchandising strategy and convenient locations enable us to offer a differentiated food shopping experience with broad appeal to a diverse and dynamic customer demographic.
Outlook
We plan to expand our store footprint, primarily through opening new Extra! stores in existing and adjacent markets, and over time by entering new markets. We believe we have a scalable operating infrastructure to support our anticipated growth which, together with our flexible real estate strategy and advanced distribution capabilities, position us to capitalize on our growth opportunities. In 2018, we opened four new Extra! Stores and relocated three legacy Smart & Final stores to Extra! format stores. We plan to opportunistically continue to expand certain legacy Smart & Final stores to our Extra! format and invest in our legacy Smart & Final stores that are not candidates for expansion to the Extra! format by completing major remodel projects and targeted relocations. In 2018, we opened three new Smart Foodservice stores and plan to continue to grow our Smart Foodservice store footprint.
In 2019, we plan to open one additional Smart & Final Extra! store and relocate one to two legacy Smart & Final stores to Extra! format stores. We also plan to open four new Smart Foodservice stores in 2019.
In addition, we plan to leverage our significant investments in management, information technology systems, infrastructure and marketing to grow our comparable store sales and enhance our operating margins through execution of a number of key initiatives, including initiatives to increase net sales of perishable products in our Smart & Final stores, to increase net sales of private label products in our Smart & Final and Smart Foodservice stores, and to expand our marketing programs in our Smart & Final and Smart Foodservice stores. We expect each of these key initiatives, if successful, to generate increased comparable store sales and also expect our initiative to increase net sales of private label products to enhance our operating margins, as private label products have historically generated higher gross margins relative to national branded products.
Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations
Store Openings
We expect that a primary driver of our growth in sales and gross margin will be the continued development of our Extra! format stores through new store openings and expansions and relocations. We also plan to opportunistically open new Smart Foodservice stores, which will further amplify sales and gross margin. Our results of operations have been and will continue to be materially affected by the timing and number of new store openings, including conversions and relocations of legacy Smart & Final stores to the Extra! format, and the amount of associated costs. For example, we typically incur higher than normal employee costs at the time of a new store opening, expansion or relocation associated with set-up and other related costs. Also, our operating margins are typically negatively affected by promotional discounts and other marketing costs associated with new store openings, expansions and relocations, as well as higher inventory markdowns and costs related to hiring and training new employees in new stores. Additionally, promotional activities may result in higher than normalized sales in the first several weeks following a new store opening. Our new Extra! and Smart Foodservice stores typically build a customer base over time and reach a mature sales growth rate in the third and fourth year after opening, respectively. As a result, our new stores generally have lower margins and higher operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, than our more mature stores.
Based on our experience, we expect that certain of our new Extra! stores will impact sales at our existing stores in close proximity in the short-term. However, we believe that over the longer term any such sales impact will be more than offset by future sales growth and expanded market share.
Developments in Competitive Landscape
We operate in the highly competitive U.S. food retail and foodservices industry. We compete on a combination of factors, including price, product selection, product quality, convenience, customer
service, store format and location, and digital commerce options. Our principal competitors include conventional grocers such as Albertsons/Safeway and Kroger, warehouse clubs and discounters such as Costco and Aldi, mass merchandisers such as Walmart and Target, foodservice delivery companies such as Sysco and US Foods, online retailers such as Amazon, as well as other specialty stores. Some of our competitors may have greater financial or marketing resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to sourcing, promoting and selling their products. These competitors could use these advantages to take certain measures, including reducing prices that could adversely affect our competitive position, business, financial condition and operating results.
Pricing Strategy and Investments in ""Everyday Low Prices""
We have a commitment to ""everyday low prices"", which we believe positions both our Smart & Final and Smart Foodservice stores as top of mind destinations for our target customers. Pricing in our Smart & Final stores is targeted to be substantially lower than that of conventional grocers and competitive with that of large discounters and warehouse clubs, with no membership fee requirement. Pricing in our Smart Foodservice stores is targeted to be substantially lower than our foodservice delivery competitors, with no membership fee requirement and greater price transparency to customers with no minimum order size, and competitive with typical warehouse clubs.
Our pricing strategy is geared toward optimizing the pricing and promotional activities across our mix of higher-margin perishable items and everyday value-oriented traditional grocery items. This strategy involves determining prices that will improve our operating margins based upon our analysis of how demand varies at different price levels as well as our costs and inventory levels.
Private Label Products
Private label products are key components of our pricing and merchandising strategy, as we believe they build and deepen customer loyalty, enhance our value proposition, generate higher gross margins relative to national brands and improve the breadth and selection of our product offering. We believe that a strong private label offering has become an increasingly important competitive advantage in the food retail and foodservices industries.
As of December 30, 2018, for fiscal year 2018, we had a portfolio of approximately 3,100 private label items, which represented 28% of our Smart & Final banner sales. Typically, our private label products generate a higher gross margin as a percentage of sales as compared to a comparable national brand product.
General Economic Conditions and Changes in Consumer Behavior
The overall economic environment in the markets we serve, particularly California, and related changes in consumer behavior, have a significant impact on our business and results of operations. In general, positive conditions in the broader economy promote customer spending in our stores, while economic weakness results in reduced customer spending. Macroeconomic factors that can affect customer spending patterns, and thereby our results of operations, include employment rates, business conditions, changes in the housing market, the availability of consumer credit, interest rates, tax rates and fuel and energy costs.
Infrastructure Investment
Our historical results of operations reflect the impact of our ongoing investments in infrastructure to support our growth. We have made significant investments in senior management, information technology systems, supply chain systems and marketing. These investments include significant additions to our personnel, including experienced industry executives and management and merchandising teams
to support our long-term growth objectives. We plan on continuing to make targeted investments in our infrastructure as necessary to support our growth.
Inflation and Deflation Trends
Inflation and deflation can impact our financial performance. During inflationary periods, our results of operations can be positively impacted as we sell lower-priced inventory in a higher price environment. In contrast, food deflation could negatively impact our results of operations by reducing sales growth and earnings if our competitors react by lowering their retail pricing. The short-term impact of inflation and deflation is largely dependent on whether or not we pass the effects through to our customers, which is subject to competitive market conditions. In recent inflationary periods, we have generally been able to pass through most cost increases. Beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, we began to experience modest inflation in some of the food and non-food products we sell. This inflation continued through the first half of fiscal year 2018, then turned to deflation in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, before returning to modest inflation in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. We expect overall inflation to continue in fiscal year 2019.
Components of Results of Operations
Net Sales
We recognize revenue from the sale of products at the point of sale. Discounts provided to customers at the time of sale are recognized as a reduction in sales as the products are sold. Sales tax collections are presented in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss on a net basis and, accordingly, are excluded from reported sales revenues. Proceeds from the sale of our Smart & Final gift cards are recorded as a liability at the time of sale, and recognized as sales when they are redeemed by the customer. Our Smart & Final gift cards do not have an expiration date.
We regularly review and monitor comparable store sales growth to evaluate and identify trends in our sales performance. With respect to any fiscal period during any year, comparable store sales include sales for stores operating both during such fiscal period in such year and in the same fiscal period of the previous year. Sales from a store will be included in the calculation of comparable store sales after the 60th full week of operations, and sales from a store are also included in the calculation of comparable store sales if (i) the store has been physically relocated, (ii) the selling square footage has been increased or decreased or (iii) the store has been converted to a new format within a store banner (e.g., from a legacy Smart & Final store to the Extra! format).
Cost of Sales, Buying and Occupancy and Gross Margin
The major categories of costs included in cost of sales, buying and occupancy are cost of goods sold, distribution costs, costs of our buying department and store occupancy costs, net of earned vendor rebates and other allowances. Distribution costs consist of all warehouse receiving and inspection costs, warehousing costs, all transportation costs associated with shipping goods from our warehouses to our stores, and other costs of our distribution network. Store occupancy costs include store rental, common area maintenance, property taxes, property insurance, and depreciation.
Gross margin represents sales less cost of sales, buying and occupancy. Our gross margin may not be comparable to other retailers, since not all retailers include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of sales like we do. Some retailers exclude a portion of these costs (e.g., store occupancy and buying department costs) from cost of sales and include them in selling, general and administrative expenses.
Our cost of sales, buying and occupancy expense and gross margin are correlated to sales volumes. As sales increase, gross margin is affected by the relative mix of products sold, pricing strategies, inventory shrinkage and improved leverage of fixed costs.
Operating and Administrative Expenses
Operating and administrative expenses include direct store-level expenses associated with displaying and selling our products at the store level, including salaries and benefits for our store work force, fringe benefits, store supplies, advertising and marketing and other store-specific costs. Operating and administrative expenses also consist of store overhead costs and corporate administrative costs including salaries and benefits costs, share-based compensation, corporate occupancy costs, amortization expense, and other expenses associated with being a public company.
We expect that our operating and administrative expenses will increase in future periods resulting from our store development program, including the growth in the number of our stores and as a result of additional legal, accounting, insurance and other expenses associated with being a public company.
Income Tax Provision
We are subject to federal income tax as well as state income tax in various jurisdictions of the United States in which we conduct business. Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.
Equity in Earnings of Mexico Joint Venture
Our wholly owned subsidiary, Smart & Final de Mexico S.A. de C.V., is a Mexican holding company that owns a 50% interest in a joint venture. The remaining 50% of the joint venture is owned by Grupo Calimax S.A. de C.V., an entity comprising the investment interests of a family group who are also the owners of the Calimax grocery store chain in Mexico. As of December 30, 2018, this joint venture operated 15 Smart & Final stores in Northwestern Mexico, which are similar in concept to our legacy Smart & Final stores. This joint venture operates as a Mexican domestic corporation under the name Smart & Final del Noroeste, S.A. de C.V. Our interest in this joint venture is not consolidated and is reported using the equity method of accounting.
Factors Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations
Term Loan Facility
Our interest expense in any particular period is impacted by our overall level of indebtedness during that period and by changes in the applicable interest rates on such indebtedness.
2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law, making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code. Changes include a decrease in the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition from a worldwide tax system to a quasi-territorial system of taxation with respect to U.S. taxation on earnings from international business operations and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings. Additionally, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (""SAB 118"") was issued to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Act. December 22, 2018 marked the end of the measurement period for purposes of SAB 118. See Note 8, Income Taxes, in the accompanying notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for further detail.
Basis of Presentation
Our fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period ending on the Sunday closest to December 31. Each of our 52-week fiscal years consists of twelve-week periods in the first, second and fourth quarters of the fiscal year and a sixteen-week period in the third quarter. Our last completed fiscal year ended on December 30, 2018 and was a 52-week period (""fiscal year 2018""). Our fiscal year ended on December 31, 2017 was a 52-week period (""fiscal year 2017"").
Results of Operations
The following table summarizes key components of our results of operations for the periods indicated, both in dollars and as a percentage of sales.
The table below sets forth the components of our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of sales.
Fiscal Year 2018 Compared to Fiscal Year 2017
Net Sales
Net sales for fiscal year 2018 increased $171.2 million, or 3.7%, to $4,741.8 million as compared to $4,570.6 million for fiscal year 2017. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to the opening of 4 new Extra! stores and three new Smart Foodservice stores in fiscal year 2018, as well as the opening of 14 new Extra! stores and four new Smart Foodservice stores in fiscal year 2017. Non-comparable stores contributed $115.9 million and comparable stores contributed $55.3 million of the total net sales increase in our store banners.
Comparable store sales for fiscal year 2018 increased 1.2% as compared to fiscal year 2017. This increase in comparable store sales was attributable to a 2.3% increase in comparable average transaction size and offset by a decrease in comparable transaction counts of 1.1%.
Net sales for our Smart & Final segment increased $114.5 million, or 3.2%, to $3,672.2 million as compared to $3,557.7 million for fiscal year 2017. Of this increase in net sales, $95.1 million was primarily attributable to the 4 new Extra! stores opened in 2018 and 14 new Extra! stores opened in 2017. Comparable store sales for fiscal year 2018 for our Smart & Final segment increased 0.6% as compared to fiscal year 2017, driven by a 1.8% increase in comparable average transaction size and offset by 1.2% decrease in comparable average transaction counts.
Net sales for our Smart Foodservice segment increased $56.7 million, or 5.6%, to $1,069.6 million as compared to $1,012.9 million for fiscal year 2017. Of this increase in net sales, $20.7 million was primarily attributable to the three new Smart Foodservice stores opened in 2018 and the four new Smart Foodservice stores opened in 2017. Comparable store sales for fiscal year 2018 for our Smart Foodservice segment increased 3.6% as compared to fiscal year 2017, attributable to a 3.4% increase in comparable average transaction size and a 0.2% increase in comparable transaction counts.
Gross Margin
Gross margin for fiscal year 2018 increased $44.0 million, or 6.5%, to $717.6 million as compared to $673.7 million in fiscal year 2017. As a percentage of sales, gross margin for fiscal year 2018 was 15.1% as compared to 14.7% in fiscal year 2017. The increase in gross margin attributable to increased sales was $25.2 million, and $18.7 million was attributable to an increase in gross margin rate. Compared to fiscal year 2017, gross margin as a percentage of sales for fiscal year 2018 included higher merchandise product margin rates (including the effect of inventory losses) as a percentage of sales (accounting for an increase of 0.54%, including a 0.33% increase in our Smart & Final segment and a 0.21% increase in our Smart Foodservice segment) offset by higher store occupancy costs as a percentage of sales (accounting for a 0.06% increase, including a 0.03% increase in our Smart & Final segment and a 0.03% increase in our Smart Foodservice segment). The increase in store occupancy costs in our Smart & Final segment was primarily due to increased building rent and depreciation costs related to our new store leases and capital spending for new and relocated stores. Warehouse and transportation costs as a percentage of sales were higher by 0.09% (including a 0.07% increase in our Smart & Final segment and a 0.02% increase in our Smart Foodservice segment). Buying department costs remained constant as a percentage of sales in our Smart & Final segment.
Operating and Administrative Expenses
Operating and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2018 were $682.3 million as compared to $621.1 million in fiscal year 2017. As a percentage of sales, operating and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2018 were 14.3% as compared to 13.6% in fiscal year 2017. The increase in operating and administrative expenses was primarily due to $27.8 million of increased wages, fringe benefits and incentive bonus costs, $18.2 million of increased costs associated with store closures and asset
impairment charges, $9.5 million of increased other store direct expenses, $0.8 million of increased share-based compensation expense associated with our equity compensation program, $1.6 million increase in expense associated with changes in cash surrender values on company owned life insurance policies and other expenses of our supplemental executive retirement plan, $0.2 million of increased public company costs and $3.4 million of increased other costs (primarily due to information technology consulting costs and system upgrade costs). Partially offsetting these increases was a $0.3 million decrease in marketing costs. As a percentage of sales, operating and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2018 increased 0.75% to 14.3% as compared to fiscal year 2017. Approximately 0.28% of the increase in operating and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was due to increased wages, fringe benefits and incentive bonus costs (including 0.22% increase in our Smart & Final segment and 0.06% increase in our Smart Foodservice segment), 0.28% of the increase was due to increase in costs associated with store closures and asset impairment charges, 0.12% of the increase was due to increase in other store direct expenses primarily in our Smart & Final segment and 0.11% of the increase was due to other cost increases. Partially offsetting these increases was a 0.04% decrease in marketing costs.
Goodwill Impairment
Goodwill impairment for fiscal year 2018 was $94.0 million compared to $180.0 million in 2017. The goodwill impairment recorded in fiscal year 2018 is discussed further in the Critical Accounting Estimates section below.
Interest Expense, Net
Interest expense was $42.9 million for fiscal year 2018 and $36.5 million for fiscal year 2017. As a percentage of sales, interest expense was 0.9% for fiscal year 2018 and 0.8% for fiscal year 2017. This increase in interest expense was primarily due to increase in the interest rate on our floating rate debt.
Income Tax Provision
Our income tax provision for fiscal year 2018 was $12.7 million as compared to an income tax benefit of $24.0 million in fiscal year 2017. Our effective income tax rate for fiscal year 2018 was an income tax provision rate of (12.7)% as compared to an income tax benefit rate of 14.8% in fiscal year 2017. The income tax expense increased in fiscal year 2018 primarily due to the increase in valuation allowance on California state deferred tax assets. Factors leading to the income tax benefit in fiscal year 2017 include the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities in the amount of $27.4 million and the $0.1 million of the current tax expense recorded in connection with the transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings.
Equity in Earnings of Joint Venture
Equity in earnings of our joint venture for fiscal year 2018 was $2.1 million as compared to $0.9 million in fiscal year 2017. Reported earnings in the joint venture include the effect of changes in the conversion value of the functional currency to U.S. dollars.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Historically, our primary source of liquidity has been cash flows from operations. Additionally, we have the availability to make borrowings under the Credit Facilities. Our primary uses of cash are for purchases of inventory, operating expenses, capital expenditures primarily for opening, expanding or remodeling stores and debt service. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash anticipated to be generated by operating activities, and borrowings under the Credit Facilities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months. As of December 30,
2018, we had $30.0 million drawn under our Revolving Credit Facility and $67.2 million of cash and cash equivalents.
The following table sets forth the major sources and uses of cash for each of the periods set forth below, as well as our cash and cash equivalents at the end of each period.
Fiscal Year 2018 Compared to Fiscal Year 2017
Operating Activities
Cash flows from operating activities consist of net loss adjusted for non-cash items including depreciation and amortization, deferred taxes and the effect of working capital changes. The increase or decrease in cash provided by operating activities reflects our operating performance before non-cash expenses and charges and including the timing of receipts and disbursements.
Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2018 decreased $28.3 million to $141.2 million as compared to $169.5 million for fiscal year 2017. This decrease was primarily attributable to increased working capital. During fiscal year 2018, we made cash interest payments of $39.3 million and cash pension contributions of $8.8 million, as compared to cash interest payments of $34.0 million and cash pension contributions of $11.7 million during fiscal year 2017.
Investing Activities
Cash used in investing activities decreased $31.1 million to $131.5 million for fiscal year 2018 as compared to $162.6 million in fiscal year 2017. This decrease was primarily attributable to a $33.2 million decrease in capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment largely as a result of lower number of new stores opened in 2018, and a $0.7 million decrease in other investments. This overall decrease was partially offset by an increased investment in capitalized software of $4.4 million and a $1.6 million increase in proceeds on sale of assets..
Financing Activities
Cash provided by financing activities decreased $24.7 million to cash used of $14.2 million for fiscal year 2018 as compared to cash provided of $10.5 million for fiscal year 2017. This decrease was primarily attributable to $68.0 million reduction of net borrowings on our Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility, net of loan fees paid, a $1.8 million increase in payments on promissory note and a $0.8 million decrease in proceeds received from stock option exercises, partially offset by $31.9 million of cash received from landlords related to financing lease obligations, a $12.9 million reduction in stock repurchases and a $1.1 million decrease in payment of minimum withholding taxes on net share settlement of stock option exercises.
At December 30, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $67.2 million, stockholders' equity of $308.2 million and debt, net of debt discount and debt issuance costs of $648.3 million. At December 30, 2018, we had working capital of $32.3 million as compared to working capital deficit of $14.7 million at December 31, 2017, primarily due to $51.0 million in net payments made on our Revolving Credit Facility.
Capital Expenditure and Other Capital Requirements
Our primary uses of capital are to finance store development costs for buildings, leasehold improvements, equipment and initial set-up expenditures for new, relocated, expanded and remodeled stores, investment in our distribution network, investment in information systems hardware and capitalized software, as well as general working capital requirements.
During fiscal year 2018, we opened 4 new Extra! stores, as well as three new Smart Foodservice stores. We currently plan to open 1 new Extra! store and 4 new Smart Foodservice stores in fiscal year 2019. We estimate that the capital expenditure",0
"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Overview
We provide product development and design services, precision metal and plastic part manufacturing, product assembly services and supply chain management. We provide our products and services to each of the following primary target markets:
. Surgical Instrumentation devices and components;
. Electro-Medical Implant devices and components;
. Interventional devices and components; and
. Orthopedic implants and instruments.
Company History
During 1998, our co-founders, Richard J. Effress and William J. Kidd, established MedSource to identify business opportunities in the medical engineering and manufacturing services industry. During March 1999, with additional equity capital from Whitney & Co., we acquired seven unaffiliated businesses to begin our operations. The original seven acquisitions were Kelco Industries, W.N. Rushwood d/b/a Hayden Precision Industries, National Wire and Stamping, The MicroSpring Company, Portlyn, Texcel and Brimfield Precision. Our first fiscal period, which ended July 3,1999, consisted of only three months of consolidated results, which included material one-time expenses for business combination and formation.
Since our initial acquisitions, we had acquired six additional businesses through June 30, 2003. We acquired Tenax in January 2000, Apex Engineering in February 2000 and Thermat Precision in May 2000. The acquisition of Tenax provided injection molding capability, the acquisition of Thermat added injection molding and precision metal injection manufacturing capabilities to our operations, enabling us to manufacture low cost precision stainless steel components, and the acquisition of Apex Engineering provided mold design and plastic injection molding and mold making capabilities. We acquired ACT Medical in December 2000. The acquisition of ACT Medical enhanced our product design and development engineering expertise and provided a low cost assembly operation in Mexico. We acquired HV Technologies, or HVT, in January 2002. The acquisition of HVT, a specialized manufacturer of polyimide and composite micro-tubing used in interventional and minimally invasive catheters, delivery systems and instruments, enabled us to expand our offering of proprietary manufacturing capabilities to our customers in the interventional device market. We acquired Cycam Inc. in September 2002. The acquisition of Cycam, a manufacturer of reconstructive implants, provided us with complimentary capabilities of plastic machining, surface coatings, near net shape forging and sterilized packaging and kitting of orthopedic implants. Cycam also had strong relationships with several leading orthopedic companies where we had only a minor presence. All of our acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.
Restructuring Activity
During fiscal 2003, we performed a comprehensive review of our manufacturing operations and support functions to consolidate facilities in an effort to achieve greater economies of scale. As a result of
this analysis we identified opportunities to further restructure our operations. We estimate the total cost of this restructuring plan will be approximately $15.0 - $20.0 million and we expect to incur these charges through fiscal 2005. As of June 30, 2003 we had incurred $1.3 million in charges related to this restructuring plan. In addition, we estimate that we will invest $1.7 million in plant and equipment to ensure the facility consolidation does not disrupt operations. During fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2005, we expect to incur $5.8 - 8.3 million and 7.9 - $10.4 million, respectively, in restructuring charges related to this plan. $5.8 - $8.3 million and $7.9 - $10.4
During June 2001, we completed the first review of our manufacturing operations and support functions. Based on our evaluation of the unique and common characteristics of our various facilities, we determined that we could achieve over-all cost savings by closing three of the facilities, thus improving capacity utilization and efficiency of the remaining facilities. We sold our facilities in Pittsfield and East Longmeadow, Massachusetts during our fiscal year ended June 30, 2002. During fiscal 2003 we shut down our Danbury, Connecticut facility. In addition, during fiscal 2003 management decided to close a fourth facility located in Redwood City, California as part of this restructuring plan. This decision led to additional restructuring charges during fiscal 2003.
Results of Operations
Revenues
We primarily recognize product revenue at the time products are shipped. Product shipments are supported by purchase orders from customers that indicate the price for each product. For services, we recognize revenues primarily on a time and materials basis. Service revenues are supported by customer orders or contracts that indicate the price for the services being rendered. For fiscal 2003, service revenues were less than 10% of total revenues. Revenues for product shipments and services rendered must also have reasonable assurance of collectability from the customer. Reserves for returns and allowances are recorded against revenues based on management's estimates and historical experience.
We target the sale of our products and services to medical device companies in four target markets. As we have continued to focus on these markets, our sales to nonmedical customers as a percentage of our total revenues have been decreasing over time. Sales to nonmedical customers were approximately 2% of our total revenues for the year ended June 30, 2003. We expect sales to nonmedical customers as a percentage of our total revenues to continue to decrease in the future.
Historically, most of our revenues were derived from the manufacture of components used in medical devices. However, in order to accelerate revenue growth and better serve our customers, we aggressively pursued opportunities for the assembly of completed devices. To support this effort, we have completed a number of acquisitions to expand our product offerings and enhance our supply chain services. Over time, we anticipate that revenues from the assembly of completed devices will likely continue to grow as a percentage of our total revenues. Nevertheless, we will continue to aggressively pursue component sales opportunities.
Our top four customers accounted for 56% of our revenues for the year ended June 30, 2003, with one customer accounting for 27% of our revenues, another accounting for 12%, and a third customer accounting for 11% of our revenues. For the year ended June 30, 2002, our top four customers accounted for 52% of our revenues, with one customer accounting for 25% of our revenues and another accounting for 12% of our revenues. We expect revenues from our largest customers to continue to constitute a significant portion of our total revenues.
We primarily derive our revenues from serving leading medical device companies. These customers are typically large companies with substantial market share in one or more of our four target markets, and we believe that expanding our relationships with these customers represents our most important revenue opportunity. As a result, we devote significant sales efforts to securing additional business from the business units and product lines of the leading medical device companies that we currently serve, as well as developing business with other business units and product lines of these customers. As we increasingly focus on serving customers and expanding our offerings to them by developing or acquiring additional engineering and manufacturing capabilities, we expect the percentage of revenues we derive from these customers to increase over time, as compared with revenues from non-medical device companies. We also intend to continue to selectively pursue promising opportunities with emerging medical device companies.
As discussed above, we have acquired six businesses since we began operations during March 1999. A substantial portion of our revenue growth to date has been attributable to the addition of these acquired companies' revenues. In the periods following these acquisitions, we have grown our revenues by offering our existing customers access to our newly acquired engineering and manufacturing capabilities, as well as by offering the customers of the acquired businesses access to our existing capabilities. We generally have retained the medical device customers of the companies that we have acquired, but have selectively discontinued business with customers of the acquired businesses that did not fit our strategic focus of serving leading and select emerging medical device companies in our four target markets or related medical fields. We expect to continue to make select acquisitions of complementary medical engineering and manufacturing services providers that bring desired capabilities, customers and / or geographic coverage that either strengthens our position in our target markets or provide us with a significant presence in a new market.
We generally do not have long-term volume commitments from our customers, and they may cancel their orders or change or delay volume levels at any time.
Cost and Expenses
Cost of products sold includes expenses for raw materials, purchased components, outside services, supervisory, engineering and direct production manpower including benefits, production supplies, depreciation and other related expenses to support product manufacturing. We purchase most of the raw materials that are used in our products at prevailing market prices and, as a result, are subject to fluctuations in the market price of those raw materials. In particular, the prices of stainless steel, titanium and platinum have historically fluctuated, and the prices that we pay for these materials, and, in some cases, their availability, are dependent upon general market conditions.
Gross margins as a percentage of revenues for the years ended June 30, 2003 and 2002 were 25.6% and 26.3%, respectively. Our margins are driven by sales mix between devices and components as well as the respective product mixes within our various product categories. Historically, our component business produced strong gross margins. When we were initially formed during March 1999, we were predominately a components supplier. However, in order to expand the scope of our services and accelerate revenue growth, we aggressively pursued opportunities for the assembly of completed devices, which generally have higher material content and a lower value added content, resulting in slightly lower gross margins but with lower capital investment.
Selling, general and administrative expense includes support of our facilities for production and shipments to the customer as well as strategic investments in our sales and marketing, operations and quality teams, and our corporate support staff.
We have accounted for all of our acquisitions by using the purchase method of accounting. Through our year ended June 30, 2001, we amortized goodwill and other intangibles attributable to our acquisitions and incurred associated amortization expense. Effective July 1, 2001, in connection with our adoption of SFAS No. 142,"" Goodwill and Other Intangibles,"" we no longer amortize goodwill. Instead, we periodically test goodwill and intangibles for impairment and record an expense if those assets become impaired, as further discussed under ""--Recent Accounting Pronouncements.""
Comparison of Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2003 and June 30, 2002
Revenues for our fiscal year ended June 30, 2003 totaled $177.3 million compared to $158.9 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2002, an increase of 12%. Approximately 5% of this increase was due to the acquisition of Cycam, with the other 7% due to internal growth. Our internal, or organic, growth was primarily driven by strength in our surgical instrumentation market, orthopedics market, and our electro-medical implant market. A small portion of our internal growth also resulted from new surgical instrumentation and interventional business that we secured by offering our existing customers additional manufacturing capabilities that we acquired.
Cost of products sold for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2003 totaled $132.0 million compared to $117.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2002. The increase in cost of products sold resulted principally from the increased revenues over the prior fiscal year.
Gross margins for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2003 were 25.6% compared to 26.3% for the year ended June 30, 2002. Our margins are driven by the sales mix between devices and components and the respective product mixes within our various product categories.
Selling, general and administrative expense was $33.5 million, or 18.9% of revenues, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2003 and $29.9 million, or 18.8% of revenues, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2002. The $3.6 million fiscal 2003 increase was primarily the result of the Cycam acquisition, continued investment in information technology systems, and new investments in engineering services and business excellence programs.
Amortization of intangibles was $0.3 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2003 and June 30, 2002.
During fiscal 2003, we reduced our revenue forecast. Since the reduction in forecasted revenue indicated that our goodwill and intangible assets might be impaired we performed an impairment test using the income approach. We compared the present value of the estimated future cash flows of our business to the carrying value of net assets. This analysis indicated that our goodwill and intangible assets were impaired. Therefore, with the help of external sources, we evaluated the fair value of our net assets as if we were being purchased in a business combination. We recognized a $37.7 million goodwill impairment charge and a $2.3 million impairment charge related to our intangible assets.
Restructuring charges for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2003 were $3.7 million. These charges were related to our previously announced growth and restructuring plan as well as additional charges incurred related to our fiscal 2001 restructuring plan. The additional charges related to our fiscal 2001 restructuring plan were caused by a decision to shutdown our Redwood City, California plant. No such charges were incurred during fiscal 2002.
Net interest expense was $2.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2003, compared to $7.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2002. This decrease was due primarily to the lower amounts outstanding under our senior credit facility during the most recent fiscal year.
During our fiscal year ended June 30, 2002, we also incurred a loss on debt extinguishment of $6.9 million as a result of the repayment of our subordinated debt and the debt under our old senior credit facility. The loss included a write off of $5.5 million in unamortized financing costs and discounts and a $1.4 million prepayment fee. No such loss was recorded during our fiscal year ended June 30, 2003.
Other expenses for fiscal 2003 totaled $0.1 million compared to other expenses of $4.8 million for the prior year. During fiscal 2002 we incurred a $1.9 million interest rate swap breakage fee associated with the repayment of debt and $2.9 million for service agreements terminated in conjunction with our initial public offering.
We incurred charges related to the accrual of dividends and accretion of discount on preferred stock of $31.2 million for our fiscal year ended June 30, 2002. This charge was mainly due to charges incurred in connection with the conversion of these shares into common stock in conjunction with our initial public offering.
Net loss attributed to common stockholders for fiscal 2003 totaled $35.3 million, or $1.28 per share, while net loss attributed to common stockholders for fiscal 2002 was $38.8 million, or $3.50 per share.
Comparison of Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2002 and June 30, 2001
Revenues for our fiscal year ended June 30, 2002 totaled $158.9 million compared to $128.5 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001, an increase of 24%. Approximately 15% of this increase was due to the acquisitions of HVT and ACT Medical, with the other 9% due to internal growth. Our internal, or organic, growth was primarily driven by strength in our surgical instrumentation market, orthopedics market, as well as strength in our electro-medical implant market. A small portion of our internal growth also resulted from new surgical instrumentation and interventional business that we secured by offering our existing customers additional manufacturing capabilities that we acquired.
Cost of products sold for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2002 totaled $117.1 million compared to $94.4 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001. The increase in cost of products sold resulted principally from the increased revenues over the prior fiscal year.
Gross margins for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2002 were 26.3% compared to 26.5% for the year ended June 30, 2001. Our margins are driven by the sales mix between devices and components and the respective product mixes within our various product categories.
Selling, general and administrative expense was $29.9 million, or 18.8% of revenues, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2002 and $26.2 million, or 20.4% of revenues, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001. The $3.7 million increase was due to the selling, general and administrative expense attributable to the business of HVT, which we acquired during January 2002, and the business of ACT Medical, which we acquired during fiscal 2001.
Net interest expense was $7.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2002 compared to $10.2 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001. This decrease was due primarily to the lower amounts
outstanding under our senior credit facility during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended June 30, 2002.
Other expense for the year totaled $4.8 million compared to other income of $0.1 million for the prior year. The increase is a result of two charges, $1.9 million of interest rate swap breakage fees associated with the repayment of debt and $2.9 million for service agreements terminated in conjunction with our initial public offering.
During our fiscal year ended June 30, 2002, we also incurred a loss on debt extinguishment of $6.9 million as a result of the repayment of our subordinated debt and the debt under our old senior credit facility. The loss included a write off of $5.5 million in unamortized financing costs and discount and a $1.4 million prepayment fee.
We incurred charges related to the accrual of dividends and accretion of discount on preferred stock of $31.2 million for our fiscal year ended June 30, 2002, compared to $9.7 million for our fiscal year ended June 30, 2001. The increase was mainly due to charges in connection with the conversion of these shares into common stock in conjunction with our initial public offering.
Net loss attributed to common stockholders for fiscal 2002 totaled $38.8 million, or $3.50 per share, while net loss attributed to common stockholders for fiscal 2001 was $29.1 million, or $5.55 per share.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our principal sources of liquidity are cash provided by operations and borrowings under our senior credit facility, which includes a $15 million unused revolving credit facility. Our cash is primarily used to finance acquisitions, meet debt service requirements, finance capital expenditures, and fund working capital requirements. We expect that these uses will continue in the future.
Management believes that current cash balances and cash generated from operations, combined with available borrowings under our senior credit facility, will be adequate to fund requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, and future expansion through fiscal 2004.
Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $9.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2003 compared to net cash used in operating activities of $7.8 million for the prior year. The increase in cash provided by operating activities over the prior year period is primarily the result of an $8.2 million improvement in net operating asset management, and a $8.6 million decrease in net cash losses from operations.
Investing Activities
Cash used in investing activities was $35.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2003, compared to $14.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2002. This increase was due to an increase in cash paid for acquisitions of $16.3 million over the prior year period, as a result of the acquisition of Cycam in fiscal 2003. Cash paid for capital expenditures was up $4.2 million when compared to the prior year period. We expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2004 to be approximately $9.5 million.
Financing Activities
Cash used in financing activities was $1.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2003 compared to $40.4 million provided by financing activities for the year ended June 30, 2002. The $41.6 million decrease was primarily due to IPO proceeds received during fiscal 2002. However, this decrease was partially offset by $8.0 million of proceeds from our acquisition line and $3.8 million in proceeds from a sale-leaseback of manufacturing equipment in fiscal 2003. No transactions of this nature were recognized in fiscal 2002.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any ""off-balance sheet arrangements"" (as such term is defined in Item 303 of Regulation S-K) that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
Commitments
As of June 30, 2003, we had the following future contractual cash commitments:
As of June 30, 2003, we had $2.0 million of future commercial commitments, related to our capital leases, that may result in future cash outflows. These commitments are letters of credit and will expire in accordance with our capital lease expiration dates.
Senior Credit Facility
In fiscal 2003, we amended our senior credit facility to provide relief from certain of our debt covenants. The amendment reduced our revolving credit facility to $15.0 million from $25.0 million. Prior to the amendment, we also had a $40.0 million term loan and an $8.0 million acquisition loan under the senior credit facility (earlier in fiscal 2003, we had borrowed $8.0 million under the acquisition line (which is no longer available) to finance our acquisition of Cycam). In conjunction with the amendment of the credit facility, we made a payment of $7.5 million. Of the $7.5 million payment, $6.5 million represented a payment on the $40.0 million term loan and the remainder was applied toward the acquisition loan. All loans under our amended senior credit facility will mature in fiscal 2007.
During fiscal 2004, we will be required to make payments under the term loan of $5.0 million payable in quarterly installments. During fiscal 2005, fiscal 2006, and fiscal 2007, we will be required to make payments of $7.4 million, $9.2 million, and $7.9 million, respectively, each also payable in quarterly installments. During fiscal 2004, we will also be required to make payments under the acquisition loan of $1.4 million, also payable in quarterly installments. During fiscal 2005, fiscal 2006, and fiscal 2007, we
will be required to make payments of $1.6 million, $2.2 million, and $1.8 million on the acquisition loan, each also payable in quarterly installments.
At our option, interest rates applicable to loans under our new senior credit facility will be either:
. The greater of the bank's prime rate plus a margin, which depends upon our leverage ratio, ranging from 50 to 175 basis points, or
. LIBOR plus a margin, which depends upon our leverage ratio, ranging from 225 to 350 basis points.
We have entered into an interest rate cap agreement to protect against interest rate fluctuations with respect to the term loans outstanding under our senior credit facility. This agreement, executed with a highly-rated financial counter-party, provides for the counter-party to make payments to us in the event that a reference floating rate index exceeds an agreed-upon fixed rate. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate cap agreement are accounted for as a cash flow hedge.
The amended senior credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants and limitations, including, but not limited to, required minimum coverage of our obligations to pay interest and incur fixed charges, restrictions on our ability to pay dividends, make other payments and enter into sale transactions, limitations on liens, limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness and agreements that we use excess cash on hand and proceeds from future equity issuances to pay down our senior credit facility. Consistent with credit facilities of this type, if we do not comply with the covenants in the credit facility, the maturity date of our obligations under the credit facility could be accelerated. In addition, we also need the consent of the lender's to make any acquisition in which we pay more than $10.0 million (including more than $5.0 million in cash, deferred payments and the assumption of debt) or pay more than $20.0 million (including more than $10.0 million in cash, deferred payments and the assumption of debt) for all of the acquisitions that we complete during any fiscal year.
The amended senior credit facility is secured by all of our assets and contains various events of default, including, but not limited to, defaults upon the occurrence of a change of control of MedSource and defaults for non-payment of principal interest or fees, breaches of warranties or covenants, bankruptcy or insolvency, ERISA violations and cross-defaults to other indebtedness.
Issuances of Preferred Stock for Cash
In fiscal 2001, we received an aggregate of $5.5 million from the issuance of our Series E preferred stock, and we received an additional $0.5 million in January 2002. In connection with these issuances, we also issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 200,000 shares of our common stock at $0.01 per share. The proceeds from the Series E preferred stock were used to help finance the acquisition of HVT. During April 2002 we redeemed 4,065 shares of the 6,000 outstanding shares. The remaining 1,935 shares were redeemed during August 2002.
Quarterly Results
The following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly consolidated financial information for the eight quarters ended June 30, 2003. This unaudited quarterly consolidated information, in the opinion of management, includes all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of such information in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. These quarterly results are not necessarily indicative of future results, growth rates or quarter-to-quarter comparisons.
We have completed six acquisitions since July 1, 2000, but the quarterly consolidated financial information set forth below is presented on an actual historical basis, not on a pro forma basis for any of those acquisitions. The increase in revenues over the periods presented resulted from both acquisitions and growth in our base business. In addition, during our limited operating history, excluding the impact of acquisitions, we have experienced higher than average revenues during the last quarter of our fiscal year and lower than average revenues during the first quarter of our fiscal year, but we cannot predict whether this will continue.
Critical Accounting Policies
Certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. These judgments are based on our historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our observance of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers, and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. Actual results may differ from these judgments under different assumptions or conditions. Our accounting policies that require management to apply significant judgment include:
. Allowances for doubtful accounts. We specifically analyze our accounts receivable, historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness, and current economic trends, when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts. The reserve requirements are based on the best facts available to us and are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received. We are not able to predict changes in our customers' financial condition. If the condition of our customers deteriorates we may have to update our estimates, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. As of June 30, 2003, we had $0.8 million reserved against our accounts receivable.
. Excess and obsolete inventories. We state our inventory at the lower of first-in first-out cost or market. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next six to nine months. Generally, our inventory reserve requirements decrease as demand increases. Likewise, as demand decreases our inventory reserve requirements increase. Any significant unanticipated changes in demand due technological obsolescence, product life cycles, or declining market conditions could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results.
. Impairment of goodwill and other intangibles. We adopted SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, during fiscal 2002. We are required to test goodwill for impairment annually or at other times if indicators of impairment exist that indicate the carrying value of our goodwill may not be recoverable. The impairment test for goodwill involves a two-step process: step one consists of a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including the goodwill associated with the reporting unit. If the carrying amount is in excess of the fair value, step two requires the comparison of the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill. Any excess in the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill will be recorded as an impairment loss. Fair value of the reporting unit was determined using the income approach. Under the income approach, fair value is determined by estimating the present value of the future economic benefits to be derived from the reporting unit. We have concluded that we have one reporting unit for purposes of this impairment test. The income approach requires significant estimates of future cash flows. Future adverse changes in business or market conditions could negatively affect our future cash flows and impair the value of our goodwill. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
Item 8 of this form 10-K for information about the results of the goodwill impairment tests. As of June 30, 2003, $96.6 million of goodwill remained on our balance sheet, which represents 44.3% of our total assets.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In October 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard, or SFAS, No. 144, ""Accounting for the Impairment of Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,"" which replaced SFAS No. 121, ""Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long -Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of."" Though SFAS No. 144 retained the basic guidance of SFAS No. 121, regarding when and how to measure an impairment loss, it provided additional implementation guidelines. We adopted this statement in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and do not believe its adoption will have a material impact on our financial statements.
In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145 ""Rescission of FASB Statement No. 4, 44, and 62, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical corrections. SFAS No. 145 required us to reclassify the fiscal 2002 $6.9 million loss on debt extinguishment as a loss from continuing operations rather than an extraordinary item. The provisions of SFAS No. 145 are effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. Accordingly, we adopted this standard beginning in the first ",0
"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
INTRODUCTION
Description of Business
Chemtura is among the largest publicly traded specialty chemical companies in the United States and is dedicated to delivering innovative, market-focused specialty chemical solutions and consumer products. The Company is headquartered in Middlebury, Connecticut, and operates in a wide variety of end-use markets, including automotive, transportation, construction, packaging, agriculture, lubricants, plastics for durable and non-durable goods, electronics, and home pool and spa chemicals. The majority of our chemical products are sold to industrial manufacturing customers for use as additives, ingredients or intermediates that add value to their end products. Our crop and consumer products are sold to dealers, distributors and major retailers. We are a market leader in many of our key product lines and transact business in more than 100 countries.
The primary economic factors that influence the operations and sales of the Company’s Polymer Additives and Performance Specialties segments are industrial production, residential and commercial construction, electronic component production and polymer production. In addition, the Company’s Crop Protection segment is influenced by worldwide weather, disease and pest infestation conditions. The Company’s Consumer Products segment is also influenced by general economic conditions impacting consumer spending and weather conditions. For additional factors that impact the Company’s performance, see the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Other major factors affecting the Company’s financial performance include industry capacity, customer demand, raw material and energy costs, and selling prices. Selling prices are influenced by the global demand and supply for the products we produce. The Company’s strategy is to pursue selling prices that reflect the value of our products and to pass on higher costs for raw material and energy to preserve our profit margins. Our long-term financial performance target is to achieve a 15% minimum average operating profit margin across our business portfolio.
Annual sales for 2008 decreased $201 million or 5% compared with 2007. This decrease was due primarily to reduced sales volume of $227 million and a $205 million reduction due to the divestitures of the oleochemicals and organic peroxides businesses as well as the Celogen®, Diamond, and Terraclor product lines. These reductions were partially offset by $159 million of price increases, primarily related to the Polymer Additives and Performance Specialties segments, reflecting the partial recovery of increases in the costs of raw materials during the year. The Company’s selling price increases during the year did not fully offset increases of $205 million in raw material and energy costs.
The Polymer Additives segment operating profit decreased 82% compared with the prior year. Higher selling prices, particularly in antioxidant, PVC and surfactant product lines, were not sufficient to offset lower volume and unfavorable product mix and increases in raw material, energy and manufacturing costs.
The Performance Specialties segment operating profit decreased 4% compared with 2007 due to higher raw material, energy, manufacturing and freight costs, that were only partially offset by higher selling prices.
Operating profit for the Consumer Products segment decreased 19% in 2008 due to lower volume and unfavorable product mix and increased raw material, energy and manufacturing costs, partially offset by higher selling prices.
The Crop Protection segment operating profit increased 34% in 2008. Operating profit benefited from higher volume, favorable product mix and lower manufacturing costs, which more than offset increased raw material, energy and other operating costs.
The Company has undertaken various cost reduction initiatives over the past several years and continues to implement cost reductions. The Company is assessing cost savings opportunities on a global basis to improve gross profit margins and reduce selling, general, administrative and research and development (“SGA&R”) expenditures as a percentage of total sales. In 2008, the Company achieved its goal of SGA&R expenditures being less than 11% of total sales.
2008 Overview
The first three quarters of 2008 were dominated by an unprecedented level of raw material and energy cost inflation. Each of the Company’s business segments saw their input costs rise rapidly. The cost of oil combined with increases in the cost of specialty metals, natural fats, oils drove this inflation. The weakening of the U.S. dollar exacerbated the trend. The Company’s businesses addressed the challenge of the increased costs by passing these costs on to their customers through higher selling prices. Each business segment responded by changing the way they contracted with customers and set prices to create the ability to pass on to customers these increased costs as rapidly as possible. Each quarter, the business segments were able to capture a larger portion of the cost increases as they became more effective in managing raw material inflation. However, the Company was unable to recover the increased costs in full during the year due to competitive pressures and contractual commitments.
The fourth quarter brought a rapid and equally unprecedented change. As the recession deepened, November and December saw sharp reductions in orders for the Company’s products as we believe customers saw or anticipated reductions in demand in the industries they served. The Polymer Additives segment experienced the greatest impact with the fourth quarter of 2008 net sales down 35% year-over-year. Demand from electronics, building and construction, polyolefin and general industrial industries saw the greatest changes. The other business segments were impacted by their more cyclically exposed customer applications.
With the sharp reduction in sales, financial performance deteriorated and the Company was required to seek an amendment and waiver from the lenders under its Credit Facility as described below under “Liquidity and Capital Resources”. The proceeds from the sale of eligible accounts receivable under the Company’s U.S. and European accounts receivable facilities declined in light of the change in financial performance. On January 23, 2009, the Company announced it had entered into a new $150 million U.S. accounts receivable facility with a three-year term. The Company is currently in discussions with the provider of its European accounts receivable facility and anticipates agreeing to certain revisions including, among other matters, a significant reduction in facility size.
The crisis in the credit markets poses a continued challenge for 2009. Under normal market conditions, the Company believes it would have had the ability to refinance its $370 million 2009 Notes due on July 15, 2009 in the debt capital markets. However, with the change in credit market conditions and the deterioration in the Company’s financial performance, the Company does not believe it will be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. As a result, the Company has launched a process to sell one of its businesses to raise the funds necessary to meet the maturity when due.
With lower revenues and constrained liquidity, the Company undertook a number of actions to reduce costs as well as conserve cash and improve liquidity. These included additional staff reductions, temporary plant closures with the furlough of employees, suspension of its dividend, reductions in capital spending and working capital reductions.
With limited demand visibility by the Company and its customers for 2009, the Company remains focused on managing its costs and its use of cash. Nevertheless, the Company will likely continue to incur operating losses in the first quarter of 2009 and its liquidity remains constrained such that it may not be sufficient to meet the Company’s cash operating needs in this period of economic uncertainty.
Significant Transactions and Events During the year ended December 31, 2008 and through the date of this filing, the following significant transactions and events have occurred:
· On February 17, 2009, the Company received notice that it is no longer in compliance with the NYSE’s share price listing standard.
· During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $665 million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill associated with the Polymer Additives and Consumer Products segments.
· On December 30, 2008, the Company announced that it entered into amendment and waiver agreements with the lenders under its Credit Facility, as well as with the providers of its U.S. accounts receivable facility. Among other matters, the amendment and waiver agreements provided a 90-day waiver of the Company’s compliance with the financial maintenance covenants until March 30, 2009, a permanent reduction in the Credit Facility commitments from $740 million to $500 million, limitations on the Company’s ability to enter into certain transactions and a grant of a security interest in the Company’s U.S. inventory subject to certain limitations. The U.S. accounts receivable facility agreement provided, among other matters, for a permanent reduction in commitments under the facility from $275 million to $100 million.
· On January 23, 2009, a special-purpose subsidiary of the Company entered into a new $150 million U.S. accounts receivable facility with a three-year term, and secured by certain accounts receivable acquired by the special-purpose subsidiary from the Company and certain of its affiliates, and the commitments under the Credit Facility were further reduced from $500 million to $350 million. The former U.S. accounts receivable facility was terminated.
· On December 11, 2008, the Company implemented a new restructuring initiative to reduce annual cash fixed costs by approximately $50 million. The initiative involves a reduction in professional and administrative staff by approximately 500 people, or about 20 percent. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company recorded a charge of $26 million associated with this program.
· On December 8, 2008, the Company announced the election of Craig A. Rogerson to the position of president, chief executive and chairman of the board. The announcement was effective immediately following the resignation of Robert L. Wood.
· On October 30, 2008, the Company announced that it would suspend payment of dividends to conserve cash and improve liquidity. It also advised that it was pursuing the sale of assets to provide funds required to meet the maturity of the $370 million notes.
· During the quarter ended June 30, 2008, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $320 million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill associated with its Consumer Products segment.
· On June 26, 2008, the Company announced that, after thoroughly exploring a potential sale, merger or other business combination involving the entire Company, it has concluded that shareholders’ interests would be best served by continuing to operate as a stand-alone company and focusing on its own growth and efficiency initiatives. The Company advised that it would continue active consideration of the Company’s other strategic options, including (among other options) select business divestitures, value-creating acquisitions, joint ventures and changes in the company’s capital structure, which could include a stock repurchase program.
· On April 30, 2008, the Company entered into an agreement with Baerlocher for the manufacture of certain heat stabilizers used in PVC Production.
· On March 12, 2008, the Company purchased the remaining shares of GLCC Laurel, LLC. The Company previously held 50% of GLCC Laurel, LLC stock.
· On February 29, 2008, the Company acquired the remaining stock of Baxenden Chemicals Limited Plc. The Company previously held 53.5% of Baxenden’s stock.
· On February 29, 2008, the Company completed the sale of its oleochemicals business and recorded a net loss of $26 million. The assets sold included inventory of $26 million, accounts receivable of $23 million, goodwill of $13 million, net fixed assets of $7 million and intangible assets of $1 million. The oleochemicals business had revenues of approximately $160 million in 2007. Proceeds from the transaction were used to reduce debt.
· On January 31, 2008, the Company completed the sale of its fluorine chemical business located at the Company’s El Dorado, Arkansas facility for an immaterial net loss. The fluorine chemical business had revenues of approximately $49 million in 2007. The fluorine chemical business is reported as a discontinued operation in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
ANTITRUST INVESTIGATIONS AND RELATED MATTERS
The Company is party to various governmental and civil antitrust proceedings. For information on these proceedings (including information on Company reserves with respect to these proceedings) see Note 19 - Legal Matters in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” under Part I of this document.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Liquidity
The Company relies on the following sources of liquidity to continue to operate as a going concern: (i) cash and cash equivalents on hand; (ii) cash generated from operations; (iii) sales of accounts receivables under the Company’s accounts receivables facilities; (iv) borrowings under the Company’s Credit Facility revolver; (v) net proceeds from asset sales; and (vi) access to the capital markets. The Company’s principal uses of cash are to provide for working capital to fund its operations and to service its debt obligations. The changes in financial markets in the late summer and fall of 2008 limited the ability of companies such as Chemtura to access the capital markets. The deepening recession in the fourth quarter of 2008 has had a significant impact on the Company’s operations, resulting in a sharp decline in financial performance. As a result, the Company’s liquidity became progressively more constrained in the fourth quarter of 2008. The Company has incurred net losses from continuing operations of $973 million, $45 million and $273 million for the years ended 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
The Company’s $370 million 2009 Notes are due and payable on July 15, 2009. In light of the recent changes in the financial markets, the Company decided in October 2008 to initiate the sale of certain business assets in order to generate the funds to meet the pending maturity. These asset sale initiatives were aided by the Company’s prior exploration of its strategic alternatives that had included the investigation of value enhancing transactions including the sale of one or more of its businesses. Unless the Company can complete a planned asset sale or a debt refinancing transaction with net after-tax proceeds sufficient to meet the redemption of these notes, it will default on its obligation to redeem these notes upon maturity. Any such default may cause a default under certain of the Company’s other debt obligations due to cross default provisions in those agreements. The asset sale process is progressing with certain buyers now working to complete their due diligence. Upon completion of due diligence, it is expected that buyers will submit final offers and the Company will be able to determine if a transaction can be completed and if so, what the net proceeds may be. However, until a definitive agreement has been negotiated, executed, and the sale closed, there can be no assurances that the Company will complete an asset sale(s) or have the funds to redeem its 2009 Notes upon maturity. Further, any such asset sale and the use of resulting net proceeds, requires the consent of the lenders under the Credit Facility and the purchasers under the Company’s new U.S. accounts receivable facility.
In the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company undertook a sequence of actions to reduce costs as well as conserve cash. The Company continues to implement cost reduction and cash generation actions. These actions include staff reductions, temporary plant closures with the furlough of employees, suspension of its dividend, reductions in capital spending, sale of surplus assets and working capital reductions.
Due to the sharp decline in customer demand in November and December 2008, and the resulting decline in sales, the Company’s financial performance deteriorated sharply in the fourth quarter of 2008 resulting in the Company’s inability to be in compliance with the two financial maintenance covenants under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2008. On December 30, 2008, the Company obtained a 90-day waiver of compliance with these covenants from the lenders under the Credit Facility. This waiver expires on March 30, 2009. In the current economic environment, it is unlikely that the Company’s financial performance in 2009 will be sufficient to enable it to be in compliance with these covenants as of March 31, 2009 and for the balance of 2009. The Company will therefore require a further amendment and waiver from the lenders under its Credit Facility prior to the expiration of the current waiver period in order to avoid a default under the Credit Facility. While an asset sale may generate sufficient proceeds to meet the maturity of the 2009 Notes in July of 2009, the proceeds may not be sufficient to reduce the Company’s indebtedness to a level where it can be in compliance with these covenants in light of our trailing twelve month financial performance at that time. It is therefore probable that an amendment of the financial maintenance covenants under the Credit Facility will be required at the time the lenders consider consenting to the asset sale. There can be no assurances that the lenders will grant such further waivers or amendments on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. A default under the Credit Facility would result in a default under the terms of the Company’s new U.S. accounts receivable facility, 2009 Notes, 2016 Notes and 2026 Debentures.
In light of the non-compliance with the financial maintenance covenants as of December 31, 2008 under its Credit Facility, for which the Company received a 90-day waiver, and given that it is unlikely that the Company will be in compliance with these covenants after the expiration of the 90-day waiver period and for the balance of 2009, borrowings under the Credit Facility and other debt obligations that contain cross default provisions have been recorded as current. Therefore, during the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company classified its obligations under the Credit Facility, the 2016 Notes and the 2026 Debentures, totaling $804 million, as current liabilities. Accordingly, at December 31, 2008, the Company had a working capital deficiency of $558 million.
The Company’s liquidity has been constrained by changes in its financing agreements in light of the changes in its financial performance. The Company’s availability under its Credit Facility has historically been constrained by the requirements to meet its two financial maintenance covenants. Under the terms of the amendment and waiver agreement with the lenders, fixed limits were defined on the amount the Company can have outstanding under the Credit Facility revolver. Those limits were set at $180 million for the period ended December 31, 2008, $195 million for the period ended January 31, 2009 and then $190 million for the period ended March 30, 2009.
The Company’s liquidity has been further constrained by changes in the availability under its accounts receivable facilities. The eligibility criteria and reserve requirements under the Company’s prior U.S. accounts receivable facility tightened in the fourth quarter of 2008 following a credit rating downgrade, significantly reducing the value of accounts receivable that could be sold under the facility compared to September 30, 2008. The availability and access to the Company’s European accounts receivable facility were restricted in late December in light of its financial performance. As a result, the Company is currently unable to sell additional receivables under this existing program. The new three-year U.S. accounts receivable facility entered into by a special-purpose subsidiary of the Company on January 23, 2009 has restored much of the liquidity that the Company had pursuant to the prior U.S. accounts receivable facility before the 2008 fourth quarter events. The Company is currently in discussions to revise certain terms of its European accounts receivable facility under which we are currently unable to sell additional receivables. The anticipated revisions include among other matters, significantly reducing the value of accounts receivable that can be sold under the facility from approximately $244 million (175 million) to approximately $98 million (70 million) and changes to the subsidiaries eligible to sell accounts receivable under the facility. These revisions are subject to final approval and documentation.
The Company will likely continue to incur operating losses in the first quarter of 2009 and its liquidity remains constrained such that it may not be sufficient to meet the Company’s cash operating needs in this period of economic uncertainty. If the Company would require liquidity in excess of what is available under its Credit Facility and accounts receivable facilities, there is no assurance that the Company can obtain additional liquidity on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If the Company is unable to obtain or sustain the liquidity required to operate its business, or redeem or refinance its 2009 Notes upon maturity, the Company may need to seek to modify the terms of its debts through court reorganization proceedings to allow it, among other things, to reorganize its capital structure.
The factors noted above raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Significant Acquisitions and Divestitures
On March 12, 2008, the Company purchased the remaining outstanding shares of GLCC Laurel, LLC for a note payable of $11 million. The note was paid on September 30, 2008. Since GLCC Laurel, LLC was already being consolidated in the Company’s financial statements, the purchase price was allocated to reduce the minority interest liability by $23 million. The value of the long-lived assets was reduced by $14 million since the fair value of the assets exceeded the purchase price. The residual purchase price was allocated to other assets.
On February 29, 2008, the Company acquired the remaining stock of Baxenden Chemicals Limited Plc for approximately $26 million. The purchase price was allocated to goodwill of $9 million; intangible assets of $7 million; property, plant and equipment of $5 million; and other net assets of $5 million.
On February 29, 2008, the Company completed the sale of its oleochemicals business and recorded a net loss of $26 million. The assets sold included inventory of $26 million; accounts receivable of $23 million; goodwill of $13 million; property, plant and equipment of $7 million; and intangible assets of $1 million. The oleochemicals business had revenues of approximately $160 million in 2007. Proceeds from the transaction were used to reduce debt.
On January 31, 2008, the Company completed the sale of its fluorine chemical business located at the Company’s El Dorado, Arkansas facility for an immaterial net loss. The assets sold consisted of patents and intangible assets of $12 million; inventory of $8 million; property, plant and equipment of $8 million; and other current liabilities of $1 million. The fluorine chemical business had revenues of approximately $49 million in 2007. The fluorine chemical business is reported as a discontinued operation in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Cash Flows from Operations Net cash used in operations was $11 million in 2008 compared to $149 million of net cash provided by operations in 2007. Changes in key working capital accounts are summarized below:
Favorable (unfavorable)
During 2008, accounts receivable decreased by $89 million as compared to a $22 million decrease in 2007. The 2008 decrease in accounts receivable was primarily a result of a decrease in sales volumes and the benefit of the Company’s collection efforts. In 2008, the decrease in the proceeds from the sale of accounts receivable was $136 million, compared with a decrease of $41 million in 2007. The decrease in 2008 related to reduced accounts receivable and changes in the terms of the accounts receivable facilities in both the U.S. and Europe. Inventory increased by $12 million in 2008 as compared to a decrease of $10 million in 2007. The increase in 2008 was primarily due to the impact of increases in the costs of raw material and packaging. The decrease in 2007 related primarily to planned reductions and the divestiture of the Celogen® product line. The decrease in 2008 and 2007 in accounts payable is primarily due to timing of vendor payments and additional utilization of early payment discounts offered by vendors.
During 2008, the Company’s pension and post-retirement healthcare liabilities increased by $46 million, primarily due to a decrease in the fair value of plan assets. This increase is net of contributions of $42 million, which include $22 million for domestic plans and $20 million for international plans. During 2007, the Company’s pension and post-retirement healthcare liabilities decreased by $22 million. This decrease includes contributions of $36 million, which include $23 million for domestic plans and $13 million for international plans.
Net cash provided by operations in 2008 also reflects the impact of various charges and changes in pre-existing reserves. A summary of these items and the net impact on cash flows provided by (used in) operations is as follows:
Net cash used in operations in 2008 also reflects the impact of certain non-cash charges, including $986 million in impairment charges, $237 million of depreciation and amortization expense and $5 million related to stock-based compensation expense.
Cash Flows from Investing and Financing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $98 million for 2008, which reflects net proceeds from divestures of the oleochemicals and fluorine chemicals businesses of $64 million and net cash paid for the Baxenden, GLCC Laurel and other miscellaneous acquisitions of $41 million. Additionally, capital expenditures for 2008 amounted to $121 million as compared with $117 million for 2007. Expenditures were related to the maintenance and expansion of domestic and foreign facilities, the Company’s project to move its ERP systems to a single instance of SAP 6.0, and environmental and other compliance requirements.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $114 million for 2008, which included net proceeds from borrowings of $180 million under the Credit Facility revolver and other financing activities of $1 million, partially offset by dividend payments of $36 million, payments on long-term borrowings of $31 million.
On October 30, 2008, the Company announced that it would suspend the payment of dividends to conserve cash and expand liquidity in a period of economic uncertainty.
Contractual Obligations and Other Cash Requirements
The Company has obligations to make future cash payments under contracts and commitments, including long-term debt agreements, lease obligations, environmental liabilities, antitrust settlements, post-retirement health care liabilities, facility closures, severance and related cost liabilities, and other long-term liabilities.
The following table summarizes the Company’s significant contractual obligations and other cash requirements as of December 31, 2008:
(In millions)
* Additional information is provided in the Debt, Leases, Contingencies, Legal Matters, Pension and Other Post-Retirement Plans, Restructuring and Asset Impairment Activities, and Income Taxes Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
(a) The Company’s debt agreements include various notes, debentures, bank loans and future minimum payments under capital leases for which payments will be payable through 2026. The future minimum lease payments under capital leases at December 31, 2008 were not significant. Obligations by period reflect stated contractual due dates. Despite the stated maturity date, obligations under the Credit Facility, the 2016 Notes and the 2026 Debentures have been classified as current liabilities as described under Item 7 - Liquidity.
(b) Represents operating lease obligations primarily related to buildings, land and equipment. Such obligations are net of future sublease income and will be expensed over the life of the related lease contracts.
(c) Final installment payments of fines provided in the settlement of U.S. and Canadian antitrust cases.
(d) Represents estimated payments from accruals related to the Company’s cost reduction programs, including $2 million of unrecoverable future lease costs related to the closure of the Tarrytown, NY site.
(e) Represents capital commitments for various open projects.
(f) Represents interest payments related to the Company’s various debt agreements.
(g) Primarily represents unconditional purchase commitments to purchase raw materials and tolling arrangements with outside vendors.
(h) The Company has environmental liabilities for future remediation and operating and maintenance costs directly related to remediation. The Company estimates the environmental liability could range up to $146 million. The Company has recorded a liability for environmental remediation of $107 million at December 31, 2008.
(i) Includes $30 million of expected settlement payments of direct and indirect purchaser class action lawsuits, and securities cases (net of estimated insurance recoveries of $13 million).
(j) The Company has post-retirement health care plans that provide health and life insurance benefits to certain retired and active employees and their beneficiaries. These plans are generally not pre-funded and expenses are paid by the Company as incurred, with the exception of certain inactive government related plans that are paid from plan assets.
During 2008, the Company made payments of $31 million and $5 million for operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations, respectively.
The Company funds its defined benefit pension plans based on the minimum amounts required by law plus additional voluntary contribution amounts the Company deems appropriate. Estimated future funding requirements are highly dependent on factors that are not readily determinable. These include changes in legislation, returns earned on pension investment and other factors related to assumptions regarding future liabilities. The Company made contributions of $42 million in 2008 to its domestic and international pension and post-retirement benefit plans (including payments made by the Company directly to plan participants). See “Critical Accounting Estimates” below for details regarding current pension assumptions. To the extent that current assumptions are not realized, actual funding requirements may be significantly different from those set out below. According to the requirement of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, the Company is not required to contribute to the domestic qualified pension plans in 2009. The following table summarizes the estimated future funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans under current assumptions:
Other Sources and Uses of Cash The Company expects to finance its continuing operations and capital spending requirements for 2009 from some combination of cash flows provided by operations, proceeds from sales of businesses, available cash and cash equivalents, additional sales of accounts receivable under its accounts receivable facility agreements, borrowings under its Credit Facility or other sources. However, there is no assurance that the Company can complete its planned asset sales, that it can make further drawings under its Credit Facility (other than as permitted under the December 30, 2008 amendment) or that it may be able to undertake financing transactions in the debt capital markets.
At December 31, 2008, the Credit Facility had commitments of $500 million available through July 2010 subject to the applicable agre",1
"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
General
The following is a discussion of our financial condition at December 31, 2010 and 2009 and our results of operations comparing the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 and the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. You should read this section together with the consolidated financial statements including the notes to those financial statements for the years mentioned above.
We are a leading provider of international seaborne crude oil transportation services. We also provide transportation services for refined petroleum, products. As of December 31, 2010, our fleet consisted of 37 vessels (12 Aframax vessels, 12 Suezmax vessels, seven VLCCs, two Panamax vessels and four Handymax vessels) with a total cargo carrying capacity of 5.6 million deadweight tons.
On December 16, 2008, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Amalgamation, dated as of August 5, 2008, by and among the General Maritime Corporation (“we” or the “Company”), Arlington Tankers Ltd. (“Arlington”), Archer Amalgamation Limited (“Amalgamation Sub”), Galileo Merger Corporation (“Merger Sub”) and General Maritime Subsidiary Corporation (formerly General Maritime Corporation) (“General Maritime Subsidiary”), Merger Sub merged with and into General Maritime Subsidiary, with General Maritime Subsidiary continuing as the surviving entity (the “Merger”), and Amalgamation Sub amalgamated with Arlington (the “Amalgamation” and, together with the Merger, collectively, the “Arlington Acquisition”). As a result of the Arlington Acquisition, General Maritime Subsidiary and Arlington each became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and General Maritime Subsidiary changed its name to General Maritime Subsidiary Corporation. In addition, upon the consummation of the Arlington Acquisition, the Company exchanged 1.34 shares of its common stock for each share of common stock held by shareholders of General Maritime Subsidiary and exchanged one share of its common stock for each share held by shareholders of Arlington. We acquired two VLCCs, two Panamax vessels and four Handymax vessels pursuant to the Arlington Acquisition.
General Maritime Subsidiary is the predecessor of the Company for purposes of U.S. securities regulations governing financial statement filing. The Arlington Acquisition is accounted for as an acquisition by General Maritime Subsidiary of Arlington. Therefore, the disclosures throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, unless otherwise noted, reflect the results of operations of General Maritime Subsidiary for period January 1, 2008 through December 15, 2008. The Company had separate operations for the period beginning December 16, 2008, the effective date of the Arlington Acquisition, and disclosures and references to amounts for periods after that date relate to the Company unless otherwise noted. Arlington’s results have been included in the disclosures throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations, unless otherwise noted, from the effective date of acquisition and thereafter (see “Arlington Acquisition” in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
All share and per share amounts presented throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless otherwise noted, have been adjusted to reflect the exchange of 1.34 shares of our common stock for each share of common stock held by shareholders of General Maritime Subsidiary in connection with the Arlington Acquisition.
On January 18, 2011, we entered into memoranda of agreement (the “MOAs”) to sell the Genmar Concord, the Stena Concept and the Stena Contest to affiliates of Northern Shipping Fund Management Bermuda, Ltd. (“Northern Shipping”) for net proceeds totaling $61.7 million. On January 31, 2011, we completed the sales of the Stena Contest and the Genmar Concord and on February 4, 2011, we completed the sale of the Stena Concept.
In connection with the sales of the Stena Contest, the Genmar Concord and the Genmar Concept, each vessel has been leased back to one of our subsidiaries under bareboat charters entered into with Northern Shipping for a period of seven years at a rate of $6,500 per
day per vessel for the first two years of the charter period and $10,000 per day per vessel for the remainder of the charter period. The obligations of the subsidiaries are guaranteed by us. As part of these agreements, the subsidiaries will have options to repurchase the vessels for $24 million per vessel at the end of year two of the charter period, $21 million per vessel at the end of year three of the charter period, $19.5 million per vessel at the end of year four of the charter period, $18 million per vessel at the end of year five of the charter period, $16.5 million per vessel at the end of year six of the charter period, and $15 million per vessel at the end of year seven of the charter period.
On February 8, 2011, we sold the Genmar Princess for net proceeds of $7.5 million and subsequently paid $8.2 million as a permanent reduction of the 2005 Credit Facility.
On February 23, 2011, we sold the Genmar Gulf for net proceeds of $11.0 million and subsequently paid $11.6 million as a permanent reduction of the 2005 Credit Facility.
On March 18, 2011, the Company sold the Genmar Constantine for net proceeds of $7.3 million and subsequently paid $8.8 million as a permanent reduction of the 2005 Credit Facility.
On March 15, 2011, the Company entered into a memorandum of agreement for the sale of the Genmar Progress for $8.0 million. The sale of the Genmar Progress is expected to close during the first week of April 2011.
Spot and Time Charter Deployment
We actively manage the deployment of our fleet between spot market voyage charters, which generally last from several days to several weeks, and time charters, which can last up to several years. A spot market voyage charter is generally a contract to carry a specific cargo from a load port to a discharge port for an agreed-upon total amount. Under spot market voyage charters, we pay voyage expenses such as port, canal and fuel costs. A time charter is generally a contract to charter a vessel for a fixed period of time at a set daily rate. Under time charters, the charterer pays voyage expenses such as port, canal and fuel costs.
Vessels operating on time charters provide more predictable cash flows, but can yield lower profit margins than vessels operating in the spot market during periods characterized by favorable market conditions. Vessels operating in the spot market generate revenues that are less predictable but may enable us to capture increased profit margins during periods of improvements in tanker rates although we are exposed to the risk of declining tanker rates. We are constantly evaluating opportunities to increase the number of our vessels deployed on time charters, but only expect to enter into additional time charters if we can obtain contract terms that satisfy our criteria.
Net Voyage Revenues as Performance Measure
For discussion and analysis purposes only, we evaluate performance using net voyage revenues. Net voyage revenues are voyage revenues minus voyage expenses. Voyage expenses primarily consist of port, canal and fuel costs that are unique to a particular voyage, which would otherwise be paid by a charterer under a time charter. We believe that presenting voyage revenues, net of voyage expenses, neutralizes the variability created by unique costs associated with particular voyages or the deployment of vessels on time charter or on the spot market and provides more meaningful information to us about the deployment of our vessels and their performance than voyage revenues, the most directly comparable financial measure under United States generally accepted accounting principles (or GAAP). A reconciliation of voyage revenues to net voyage revenues is as follows (dollars in thousands):
Our voyage revenues are recognized ratably over the duration of the spot market voyages and the lives of the charters, while direct vessel expenses are recognized when incurred. We recognize the revenues of time charters that contain rate escalation schedules at the average rate during the life of the contract. We calculate time charter equivalent, or TCE, rates by dividing net voyage revenue by voyage days for the relevant time period. We also generate demurrage revenue, which represents fees charged to charterers associated with our spot market voyages when the charterer exceeds the agreed upon time required to load or discharge a cargo. We calculate daily direct vessel operating expenses and daily general and administrative expenses for the relevant period by dividing the total expenses by the aggregate number of calendar days that we owned each vessel for the period.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Margin analysis for the indicated items as a percentage of net voyage revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 are set forth in the table below.
STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS MARGIN ANALYSIS
(% OF NET VOYAGE REVENUES)
(1) STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS DATA
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009
VOYAGE REVENUES - Voyage revenues increased by $36.7 million, or 10.5%, to $387.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $350.5 million for the prior year. This increase is primarily attributable to an increase in the size of our fleet, which increased vessel operating days by 9.0% to 11,644 days during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 10,681 days in the prior year. The average size of our fleet increased by 7.1% to 33.2 vessels (12.0 Aframax, 11.2 Suezmax, 4.0 VLCC, 2.0 Panamax, 4.0 Handymax) for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 31.0 vessels (12.0 Aframax, 11.0 Suezmax, 2.0 VLCC, 2.0 Panamax, 4.0 Handymax) for the prior year. Such increase is due to the acquisition of five VLCCs and one Suezmax vessel during the second half of 2010. Also contributing to the increase in voyage revenues is a significant increase in spot rates attained on our vessels under spot voyage charters for year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the prior year. These increases were partially offset by a decline in time charter rates during the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the prior year, as discussed below under “Net Voyage Revenues”. The addition of these six Metrostar Vessels to our fleet during 2010 accounted for approximately $37 million, which represents substantially all of the increase in voyage revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the prior year. With respect to the remaining vessels in our fleet other than Metrostar Vessels, during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the prior year, we had a decrease in voyage revenues associated with vessels on time charter contracts of approximately $129 million and an increase in voyage revenues associated with vessels on the spot market of approximately $129 million.
Included in voyage revenues for the year ended December 30, 2009 was $16.4 million of time charter revenue associated with the acceleration of a net liability associated with four time charter contracts. These contracts had been assigned a liability when the vessels to which the time charters relate were acquired by the Company pursuant to the Arlington Acquisition. This recorded liability had been amortized over the remaining time charter period, including the option periods. The Company accelerated the amortization on four of these time charters, having been informed by the charterer that the options would not be exercised. Accordingly, the
Company accelerated the amortization on these contracts such that the net liability would be fully amortized by the earlier of November 10, 2009 (the end of the charter period) or the earlier redelivery date indicated by the charterer on two of the vessels. Such transactions did not recur in 2010, and had the effect for the year ended December 31, 2009 of increasing time charter revenue, especially for the two VLCCs to which most of the accelerated amortization related.
Voyage revenues are expected to increase during 2011 as compared to 2010, associated with the increased size of our fleet.
VOYAGE EXPENSES - Voyage expenses increased $92.5 million, or 157%, to $151.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $58.9 million for the prior year. Substantially all of our voyage expenses relate to spot charter voyages, under which the vessel owner is responsible for voyage expenses such as fuel and port costs. This increase in voyage expenses is primarily attributable to an increase in the number of days our vessels operated under spot charters as well as a greater proportion of our larger vessels on the spot market during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the prior year which incur more voyage expenses than the smaller vessels. During the year ended December 31, 2010, the number of days our vessels operated under spot charters increased by 104% to 5,708 days (2,166 days for our Aframax vessels, 2,715 days for our Suezmax vessels, 701 days for our VLCCs, 67 days for our Panamax vessels and 59 days for our Handymax vessels) from 2,803 days (2,188 days for our Aframax vessels, 428 days for our Suezmax vessels, 151 days for our VLCCs, and 36 days for our Panamax vessels) during the prior year. Also contributing to the increase in voyage expenses during the year ended December 31, 2010 are higher fuel costs associated with higher fuel prices and a much larger proportion of our spot voyage days during 2010 being comprised of our larger vessels which consume significantly more fuel than our smaller vessels. Fuel costs increased by $76.2 million, or 216%, to $111.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $35.3 million during the prior year. This increase in fuel cost corresponds to a 55.0% increase in fuel cost per spot voyage day to $19,538 during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $12,608 during the prior year. Port costs, which can vary depending on the geographic regions in which the vessels operate and their trading patterns, increased by $11.2 million, or 68.2%, to $27.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $16.5 million during the prior year. The increase in port costs is proportionally lower than the increase in number of spot voyage days because of the much larger proportion of our spot voyage days during 2010 being comprised of our larger vessels. Larger vessels typically have longer voyages and therefore make fewer port calls.
Voyage expenses are expected to increase during 2011 as compared to 2010 as a result of a greater number of vessels expected to be on the spot market during 2011 compared to 2010.
NET VOYAGE REVENUES- Net voyage revenues, which are voyage revenues minus voyage expenses, decreased by $55.9 million, or 19.2%, to $235.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $291.6 million for the prior year. This decrease in net voyage revenues is primarily attributable to a decline in time charter rates during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the prior year period (taking into account the $16.4 million of time charter revenue for the prior year associated with the acceleration of a net liability associated with four time charter contracts described above in voyage revenues) due to vessels with time charters that expired during 2009 having rates higher than prevailing market rates being redeployed at lower rates in a softer market. Accordingly, when these time charters expired, the vessels were either put on time charters with lower rates or placed in the spot voyage charter market. Partially offsetting this decrease is a 7.1% increase in the average size of our fleet to 33.2 vessels (12.0 Aframax, 11.2 Suezmax, 4.0 VLCC, 2.0 Panamax, 4.0 Handymax) for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 31.0 vessels (12.0 Aframax, 11.0 Suezmax, 2.0 VLCC, 2.0 Panamax, 4.0 Handymax) for the prior year. Also partially offsetting this decrease is an increase during the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the prior year in TCE rates for our vessels on spot voyage charters as well as an increase in the number of vessel operating days.
Net voyage revenues are expected to increase during 2011 compared to 2010 due to the increase in the size of our fleet.
The following is additional data pertaining to net voyage revenues:
As of December 31, 2010, 16 of our vessels were on time charters expiring between January 2011 and September 2012.
DIRECT VESSEL EXPENSES - Direct vessel expenses, which include crew costs, provisions, deck and engine stores, lubricating oil, insurance, maintenance and repairs increased by $10.3 million, or 10.8%, to $105.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $95.6 million for the prior year. This increase is primarily due to an increase in the average size of our fleet which increased 7.1% to 33.2 vessels (12.0 Aframax, 11.2 Suezmax, 4.0 VLCC, 2.0 Panamax, 4.0 Handymax) for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 31.0 vessels (12.0 Aframax, 11.0 Suezmax, 2.0 VLCC, 2.0 Panamax, 4.0 Handymax) for the prior year. On a daily basis, direct vessel expenses per vessel increased by $293, or 3.5%, to $8,740 ($8,947 Aframax, $8,322 Suezmax, $11,197 VLCC, $8,026 Panamax, $7,221 Handymax) for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $8,447 ($9,095 Aframax, $8,373 Suezmax, $10,135 VLCC, $7,031 Panamax, $6,565 Handymax) for the prior year. Approximately $8.3 million of the $10.3 million increase in overall direct vessel expenses during the year ended December 31, 2010 relates to the addition of five VLCCs and one Suezmax vessel to our fleet during the second half of 2010. VLCCs, being larger, are generally more expensive to operate than the other vessels in our fleet and, therefore, the addition of such vessels to our fleet increases the daily operating costs. In addition, we had increases in the costs of operating our VLCCs, Panamax vessels and Handymax vessels. During the 2009 period, all eight of the Arlington Vessels were on fixed fee technical management contracts with Northern Marine which covered, among other things, costs related to crewing, provisions, deck and engine stores, maintenance and repair, and lubricating oils. During the fourth quarter of 2009, the fixed-fee contracts on four of these vessels expired and subsequently such vessels were placed under ship management agreements that were not of a fixed-fee nature, resulting in higher costs. During the fourth quarter of 2010, the fixed-fee contracts on another two of these vessels expired and subsequently such vessels were placed under ship management agreements that were not of a fixed-fee nature, resulting in higher costs. Therefore, for such vessels, direct vessel expenses increased for these vessels in 2010 compared to the prior year. Additionally, the two vessels still on fixed fee technical management contracts with Northern Marine incurred higher expenses during the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the prior year period as a result of annual fee increases on such contracts. Approximately $2.4 million of the increase in direct vessel expenses during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the prior year relates to changes in these fixed-fee technical management contracts. These increases are partially offset by decreases in maintenance and repair and lubricating oils for our Aframax vessels and Suezmax vessels during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the prior year associated with certain survey costs and repairs during 2009 that occurred in 2010 to a lesser extent as well as the installation of cylinder oil optimization equipment on certain vessels during the year ended December 31, 2010 that reduced lubricating oil consumption. Changes in daily costs are primarily due to reasons described above.
We anticipate that direct vessel expenses will increase to approximately $111 million during 2011 based on daily budgeted direct vessel expenses on our Aframax vessels, Suezmax vessels, VLCCs, Panamax vessels and Handymax vessels of $8,674, $8,322, $10,018, $7,231 and $7,202, respectively. The budgets for the Aframax and Suezmax vessels are based on 2010 actual results adjusted for certain 2010 events not expected to recur or anticipated 2011 events which did not occur in 2010. The budgeted amounts include no provisions for unanticipated repair or other costs. We cannot assure you that our budgeted amounts will reflect our actual results. Unanticipated repair or other costs may cause our actual expenses to be materially higher than those budgeted.
GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES-General and administrative expenses decreased by $3.7 million, or 9.2%, to $36.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $40.3 million for the prior year. Significant factors contributing to this decrease for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the prior year are:
(a) A $3.4 million decrease during the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the prior year relating to reductions in compensation relating to reduced bonuses paid.
(b) A $0.8 million decrease during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the prior year associated with ceasing the operation of our corporate aircraft, which we leased through February 2009.
(c) An aggregate decrease of $0.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the prior year associated with operating our office in Portugal relating to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro.
(d) a partially offsetting increase of $1.0 million in reserves against our amounts due from charterers associated with demurrage and certain other billings during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the prior year.
(e) a partially offsetting increase of $0.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the prior year associated with travel related costs of senior management.
For 2011, we have budgeted general and administrative expenses to be approximately $38.4 million. Such budget is based on 2010 actual results adjusted for expenses occurring during 2010 that are not expected to recur and anticipated 2011 expenses that either did not occur during 2010 or are expected to recur but at different amounts. Significant factors contributing to an increase in 2011
budgeted general and administrative expense as compared to 2010 actual results include an increase in budgeted 2011 bonuses partially offset by decreases in anticipated professional fees and travel costs. We cannot assure you that our budgeted amounts will reflect our actual results. Unanticipated costs may cause our actual expenses to be materially higher than those budgeted.
DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION - Depreciation and amortization, which include depreciation of vessels as well as amortization of drydocking and special surveys, increased by $10.4 million, or 11.8%, to $98.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $88.0 million for the prior year. Vessel depreciation increased by $9.2 million, or 12.8%, to $81.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $72.3 million during the prior year. This increase is due to acquisition of five VLCCs and one Suezmax vessel during the second half of 2010.
Amortization of drydocking increased by $0.2 million, or 1.8%, to $12.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $12.1 million for the prior year. Drydocks are typically amortized over periods from 30 months to 60 months. This increase reflects amortization during 2010 of a portion of the $15.0 million of drydock costs capitalized during the year ended December 31, 2010 and amortization for the full year of the $18.9 million of drydock costs capitalized during the year ended December 31, 2009.
Depreciation of vessel equipment increased by $1.0 million, or 32.1%, to $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $3.1 million for the prior year. This increase relates to a greater amount of equipment being capitalized to vessels during 2010 as compared to the prior year. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the carrying amount of vessel equipment was $17.8 million and $18.5 million, respectively.
Depreciation and amortization is expected to increase during 2011 as the vessels acquired during the second half of 2010 will be included in our fleet for the full year of 2011 and depreciated for a full year. Such increases will be offset by any vessels sold during 2011.
GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT - For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we recorded goodwill impairment of $28.0 million and $40.9 million, respectively. Refer to the GOODWILL section in Critical Accounting Policies.
LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF VESSEL EQUIPMENT - During the year ended December 31, 2010, we incurred losses of $0.6 million associated with the disposal of vessel equipment. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we incurred losses of $2.1 million associated with the disposal of certain vessel equipment.
LOSS ON IMPAIRMENT OF VESSELS - During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded a loss on impairment of vessels of $99.7 million. $74.4 million of this loss relates to five vessels which were classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2010 and includes writing these vessels down to their fair values, as determined by contracts to sell these vessels which were finalized in January 2011, as well the write-off of unamortized drydock costs, undepreciated vessel equipment and unamortized time charter asset balances, which were also deemed to be impaired. The remaining $25.3 million relates to three vessels for which a test for impairment of long-lived assets indicated that their future undiscounted cash flows were less than the book value of each vessel. This loss represents the amount by which the vessels’ then book values plus unamortized drydock costs and undepreciated vessel equipment exceeded their fair values.
INTEREST INCOME - Interest income was approximately $0.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Interest income on deposits with banks has been minimal during both years.
INTEREST EXPENSE - Interest expense increased by $45.0 million, or 120%, to $82.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $37.3 million for the prior year. This increase is attributable to the issuance of $300 million of Senior Notes on November 12, 2009 at a coupon interest rate of 12%, the 2010 Credit Facility we entered into during July 2010, which bore interest at 300 basis points over LIBOR and an increase in margin over LIBOR under our 2005 Credit Facility from 100 basis points to 250 basis points pursuant to an amendment to the 2005 Credit Facility on that same date. The margins on the 2005 Credit Facility and 2010 Credit Facility increased to 350 basis points on December 22, 2010 pursuant to amendment to both facilities on that date. Also, during October 2010, we borrowed $22.8 million under a Bridge Loan Credit Facility which bore interest of LIBOR plus 300 basis points. Partially offsetting this increase is a reduction in interest expense relating to the $229.5 million RBS Facility which was outstanding until its prepayment in full on November 13, 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2010, our weighted average outstanding debt increased by 18.7% to $1,139.8 million compared to $959.9 million during the prior year period.
We expect our long-term debt during 2011 to be slightly less than the amount of debt we had at December 31, 2010. During the first three months of 2011, we used proceeds from vessel sales to reduce the principal amount of our debt outstanding, and intend to borrow approximately $45.6 million during April 2011 to fund our last vessel purchase in connection with the acquisition of the Metrostar Vessels. However, as discussed below under “Liquidity and Capital Resources”, we are seeking additional liquidity through potential debt and/or equity offerings, amendments or refinancings of our existing credit facilities. Depending on the interest rate terms and structure of any such transaction we may enter into, our interest expense for 2011 may be significantly higher or lower than our interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2010.
OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) - Other expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $1.0 million and is primarily attributable to $1.2 million of foreign currency losses partially offset by a $0.2 million gain associated with our interest rate swaps. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $0.4 million and is primarily attributable to a $1.0 million recovery from a 2004 insurance claim. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2009 also reflects a realized gain on our freight derivative of $0.7 million and $0.6 million of unrealized loss on our freight derivative, a realized loss of $0.1 million associated with our interest rate swaps, and a $0.1 million unrealized gain on a bunker derivative. Offsetting this income is an unrealized loss during the year ended December 31, 2009 of approximately $0.2 million associated with foreign currency transaction losses.
NET LOSS - Net loss was $216.7 million and $12.0 million, respectively for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008
VOYAGE REVENUES- Voyage revenues increased by $24.4 million, or 7.5%, to $350.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $326.1 million for the prior year. This increase is primarily attributable to a significant increase in the size of our fleet, which increased vessel operating days by 41.1% to 10,681 days during the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 7,568 days in the prior year. The average size of our fleet increased by 44.2% to 31.0 vessels (12.0 Aframax, 11.0 Suezmax, 2.0 VLCC, 2.0 Panamax, 4.0 Handymax) for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 21.5 vessels (10.3 Aframax, 10.9 Suezmax, 0.1 VLCC, 0.1 Panamax, 0.1 Handymax) for the prior year. This increase in fleet size is attributable to the completion of construction of a Suezmax tanker in February 2008, the acquisitions during the fourth quarter of 2008 of two Aframax vessels, and the acquisition of two VLCCs, two Panamaxes, and four Handymaxes as part of the Arlington Acquisition. Also, included in this increase in voyage revenues is $16.4 million associated with the acceleration of the amortization of a net liability associated with four time charter contracts. These contracts were recorded as a liability when the vessels to which the time charters relate were acquired by the Company pursuant to the Arlington Acquisition. This recorded liability was being amortized over the remaining time charter period, including the option periods. The Company accelerated the amortization on four of these time charters, having been informed by the charterer that the options would not be exercised. Accordingly, the Company accelerated the amortization on these contracts such that the net liability would be fully amortized by the earlier of November 10, 2009 (the end of the charter period) or the redelivery date indicated by the charterer on two of the vessels. This additional revenue is nonrecurring and was noncash. This increase is partially offset by a significant reduction in rates, especially with respect to vessels under spot voyage and, to a lesser extent time charters, as well as decreased utilization rates relating to drydocking and repositioning of vessels, during the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the prior year period.
VOYAGE EXPENSES- Voyage expenses increased $4.5 million, or 8.2%, to $58.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $54.4 million for the prior year. Substantially all of our voyage expenses relate to spot charter voyages, under which the vessel owner is responsible for voyage expenses such as fuel and port costs. This increase in voyage expenses is primarily attributable to an increase in the number of days our vessels operated under spot charters. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the number of days our vessels operated under spot charters increased by 47.3% to 2,803 days (2,188 days for our Aframax vessels, 428 days for our Suezmax vessels, 151 days for our VLCCs, and 36 days for our Panamax vessels) from 1,903 days (1,549 days for our Aframax vessels and 354 days for our Suezmax vessels, the only vessels on spot charter during 2008) during the prior year. This increase is partially offset by lower fuel cost incurred during 2009. Although this increase in spot",1
"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
STRATEGIC ACTIONS
FISCAL 2000 -- RESTRUCTURING AND SPECIAL CHARGES
In response to a difficult retail environment, the Company performed a strategic review of its worldwide businesses, manufacturing, distribution and other facilities and product lines and styles. The Company initiated a global implementation of programs designed to create cost efficiencies through facility consolidations, workforce reductions and the consolidation of the finance, manufacturing and operations functions within the Company and the discontinuance of product lines and styles that were unprofitable. As a result of the initiatives, the Company recorded restructuring and special charges throughout the year in an amount equal to $269.6 million, of which $171.3 million represents non-cash asset write-downs. Of the total amount, $201.3 million is reflected in cost of goods sold and $68.3 million is reflected in selling, general and administrative. The Company anticipates that these initiatives will generate nearly $100 million of annualized savings. The detail of the charge, including costs incurred and reserves remaining for costs estimated to be incurred through completion
of the aforementioned programs are summarized below (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details):
FISCAL 1998 -- RESTRUCTURING AND SPECIAL CHARGES
Following significant acquisitions in 1996 and 1997, in the fourth quarter of 1998 the Company initiated the implementation of programs designed to streamline operations and improve profitability. As a result of the decision to implement these programs, the Company recorded restructuring and special charges of approximately $36.9 million related to costs to exit certain facilities and activities, asset impairments and employee termination and severance benefits. Of the total amount of the 1998 charges, $21.8 million is reflected in cost of goods sold and $15.1 million is reflected in selling, administrative and general expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. The detail of the charges recorded in 1998, including costs incurred through fiscal 2000, are summarized below:
See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.
In addition and related to the above actions, the fiscal 1998 operations included $53.0 million related to the first nine months of losses on discontinued product lines, severance associated with reductions in headcount, incremental advertising, allowances and manufacturing variances and $5.3 million related to fourth quarter losses on discontinued product lines. Of the total amount of $58.3 million, $27.0 million is reflected in cost of goods sold and $31.3 million is reflected in selling, administrative and general expenses.
The total restructuring and special charges including the associated operating losses are $95.2 million for fiscal 1998. The Company realized from these programs annual savings of $15.0 million.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The consolidated statements of income for the Company are summarized below.

COMPARISON OF FISCAL 2000 TO FISCAL 1999
Net revenues increased $135.7 million or 6.4% to $2,249.9 million in fiscal 2000 compared with $2,114.2 million in fiscal 1999. Included in fiscal 2000 net revenues are the results of Authentic Fitness and A.B.S acquired in December 1999 and September 1999, respectively. Excluding these acquisitions, net revenues in fiscal 2000 were down $271.4 million or 13.2% compared to fiscal 1999. The decrease versus last year resulted from the Company's loss of certain major retail customers such as Uptons, Eatons, Mercantile and SRI through bankruptcy and consolidations (over $150 million of lost revenues). The Company also believes that its business was adversely affected by the negative publicity surrounding its litigation with Calvin Klein, Inc. Fiscal 2000 revenues in its Calvin Klein businesses decreased $134.8 million to $934.2 million from $1,069.0 million in fiscal 1999.
INTIMATE APPAREL DIVISION. Net revenues decreased $136.6 million or 14.5% to $806.8 million in fiscal 2000 compared with $943.4 million in fiscal 1999. The decrease in net revenues resulted from a soft retail environment where many of our customers significantly reduced their purchases as well as several of our major accounts filing for bankruptcy or were consolidated, as discussed above. Calvin Klein Underwear net revenues decreased 11.4% to $293.5 million in fiscal 2000. Warner's/Olga core businesses decreased 14.6% to $296.8 million. Sleepwear decreased 10.2% to $61.4 million. The Bodyslimmers and Weight Watchers shapewear brands decreased 26.3% to $33.7 million. Fruit of the Loom decreased 34.0% to $27.4 million. Lejaby, the Company's European product offering, decreased 13.0%to $83.4 million primarily due to the fluctuation of the Euro in fiscal 2000. However, despite these revenue decreases, Warnaco remains a market leader for Intimate Apparel in department and specialty stores with a 35.7% share in bras, 26.2% share in panties and 20.9% share in shapewear.
SPORTSWEAR AND ACCESSORIES DIVISION. Net revenues increased $204.7 million or 20.0% to $1,227.5 million in fiscal 2000, compared with $1,022.8 million in fiscal 1999, due to acquisitions, partially offset by decreases in the Company's other businesses. Incremental net revenues contributed by the 1999 Authentic Fitness ($318.8 million) and A.B.S. ($30.7 million) acquisitions were $349.5 million. Excluding these acquisitions, net revenues decreased $144.8 million. The decrease in net revenues in Sportswear and Accessories were also reflective of the soft retail environment, heavy markdowns required to keep pace with the actions of our competitors, the lost retail accounts previously mentioned, as well as the adverse affect on the Calvin Klein businesses from the Company's litigation with Calvin Klein, Inc. Calvin Klein Jeanswear decreased 13.5% to $544.2 million. Chaps decreased 19.8% to $254.5 million and Calvin Klein Accessories increased 7.6% to $24.0 million.
RETAIL STORES DIVISION. Net revenues increased $67.6 million or 45.7% to $215.6 million in fiscal 2000. Incremental net revenues in fiscal 2000 contributed by the Authentic Fitness acquisition were $57.6 million. Excluding the acquisitions, Retail Stores were up 6.9%, primarily in the Outlet Stores where the Company was liquidating excess inventory to generate cash flow.
Gross profit decreased $238.1 million or 34.6% to $450.5 million in fiscal 2000 compared to $688.6 million in fiscal 1999. Gross margins decreased to 20.0% from 32.6%. Included in cost of goods sold in fiscal 2000 are restructuring and special charges of $201.3 million (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Excluding these charges, gross profit decreased $36.8 million or 5.4%. Gross margins on this basis were 29.0% in fiscal 2000 compared to 32.6% in fiscal 1999. The decrease in gross profit and gross margin resulted from the increased markdowns taken throughout the year to reduce inventory and improve cash flow.
INTIMATE APPAREL DIVISION. Gross profit (excluding restructuring and special charges) decreased $110.9 million or 34.4% to $211.2 million in fiscal 2000 compared with $322.1 million in fiscal 1999. Gross margins on this basis were 26.2% in 2000 compared with 34.1% in 1999. The decrease in gross profit and gross margin resulted from the net revenue decrease and the incremental markdowns mentioned above. In addition, restructuring and special charges as outlined above were $143.1 million in fiscal 2000.
SPORTSWEAR AND ACCESSORIES DIVISION. Gross profit (excluding restructuring and special charges) increased $19.5 million or 5.6% to $344.5 million in fiscal 2000, compared with $325.0 million in fiscal 1999. The increase in gross profit was attributable to the Authentic Fitness and A.B.S.
acquisitions. Gross margins on this basis were 28.1% in fiscal 2000 compared with 31.8% in fiscal 1999. This decrease was attributable to incremental inventory markdowns as previously discussed. In addition, restructuring and special charges as outlined above were $38.4 million in fiscal 2000.
RETAIL STORES DIVISION. Gross profit (excluding restructuring and special charges) increased $54.6 million or 131.6% to $96.1 million in fiscal 2000 compared with $41.5 million in fiscal 1999. Gross margins in fiscal 2000 were 44.6% compared to 28.0% in fiscal 1999. The significant increase in gross profit and gross margin in fiscal 2000 is attributable to the addition of the Speedo Authentic Fitness full-price retail stores, with gross margin of 63.7% which accounted for an incremental $36.7 million. In addition, restructuring and special charges as outlined above were $19.8 million in fiscal 2000.
Selling, administrative and general expenses increased $148.6 million or 31.2% in fiscal 2000 to $625.0 million compared with $476.4 million in fiscal 1999 primarily as a result of the acquisitions noted below. Selling, administrative and general expenses as a percentage of net revenues was 27.8% in fiscal 2000 compared with 22.5% in fiscal 1999. Included in selling, administrative and general expenses in fiscal 2000 are restructuring and special charges of $68.3 million (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Excluding these charges, selling, administrative and general expenses increased $80.3 million or 16.9%. Selling, administrative and general expenses as a percentage of net revenues on this basis increased to 24.7%. The increase resulted from an increase in the amortization of goodwill and intangibles related to the Authentic Fitness and A.B.S. acquisitions of $15.0 million and the increased costs of the Retail Stores Division primarily associated with the Authentic Fitness acquisition of $59.5 million, which is 46.2% of net revenues, significantly higher than the Company's wholesale divisions.
OPERATING PROFIT
INTIMATE APPAREL DIVISION. Operating profit (excluding restructuring and special charges) decreased $99.2 million or 65.0% to $53.4 million in fiscal 2000, compared with $152.6 million in fiscal 1999. This was attributable to the decrease in net revenues, associated with the lost accounts and soft retail environment and decrease in gross margin due to the additional markdowns taken to reduce inventory levels and improve cash flow. In addition, fiscal 2000 includes restructuring and special charges as outlined above in the amount of $171.5 million.
SPORTSWEAR AND ACCESSORIES DIVISION. Operating profit increased $20.7 million or 13.5% to $174.4 million in fiscal 2000 compared with $153.7 million in fiscal 1999. This increase was attributable to the acquisitions of Authentic Fitness and A.B.S., which were acquired in December 1999 and September 1999, respectively. In addition, fiscal 2000 includes restructuring and special charges as outlined above in the amount of $44.1 million.
RETAIL STORES DIVISION. Operating profit decreased $12.3 million to a loss of $3.3 million in fiscal 2000 compared to a profit of $9.0 million in fiscal 1999. The decrease in operating profit resulted from the markdowns taken and other costs incurred to reduce inventories and improve cash flow. In addition, fiscal 2000 includes restructuring and special charges as outlined above in the amount of $25.6 million.
Investment income in the amount of $36.9 million was recorded in fiscal 2000 and reflects the Company's first quarter gain on the sale of its investment in Interworld of $42.8 million, partially offset by a fourth quarter $5.9 million write-down on its Equity Agreements.
Interest expense increased $91.2 million to $172.2 million in fiscal 2000 compared with $81.0 million in fiscal 1999. The increase is attributable to the Company's acquisitions of Authentic Fitness and A.B.S., as well as the Company's stock buy-back program in fiscal 1999 and an increase in the Company's effective borrowing rate commencing effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000.
Income taxes in fiscal 2000 were $21.2 million, which includes a $134.4 million valuation allowance on the Company's deferred tax asset ($129.2 million U.S. and $5.2 million foreign), offset by an income tax benefit of $113.2 million related to the Company's pre-tax loss of $309.9 million or an effective tax rate of 36.5%. This compares to an income tax provision in fiscal 1999 of $33.4 million, or an effective tax rate of 25.5%. The Company has a United States net operating loss carryforward of approximately $836.0 million at December 30, 2000 and a foreign net operating loss carryforward of approximately
$49.3 million available to offset future taxable income. The net operating loss carryforwards expire between 2002 and 2020.
Net loss before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle is $331.1 million, or a loss of $6.27 per diluted share in fiscal 2000. The net loss before restructuring and special charges, investment income and the provision for deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be $48.2 million or $0.91 per diluted share. This compares to net income in fiscal 1999 of $97.8 million or $1.72 per diluted share.
COMPARISON OF FISCAL 1999 TO FISCAL 1998
Net revenues increased $163.9 million or 8.4% to $2,114.2 million in fiscal 1999 compared with $1,950.3 million in fiscal 1998. Net revenues contributed by the 1999 acquisitions of Authentic Fitness ($40.6), Penhaligon's ($7.9), IZKA ($0.2), Chaps Canada ($5.7) and A.B.S. ($13.7) amounted to $68.1 million. In addition, the Company discontinued several underperforming brands during 1998. These discontinued brands accounted for a reduction in net revenues of $18.4 million in fiscal 1999. Excluding the impact of these items, net revenues from continuing brands were up 5.8%.
INTIMATE APPAREL DIVISION. Net revenues decreased $1.4 million or 0.1%to $943.4 million in fiscal 1999 compared with $944.8 million in fiscal 1998. Discontinued brands accounted for a reduction in net revenues of $18.4 million in fiscal 1999. Excluding the impact of the discontinued brands, net revenues increased 1.9%, despite the loss of three major customers (Uptons, Eaton's and Mercantile), which accounted for a loss of $30.0 million of net revenues in fiscal 1999. Calvin Klein underwear net revenue increased $22.4 million or 7.3% over fiscal 1998, driven by strong growth in the domestic men's business. Sleepwear net revenues increased $16.7 million or 32.4% due to the addition of several new customers, including Wal-Mart. The Bodyslimmers and Weight Watchers shapewear brands increased $21.6 million or 89.6% due to the continued strength of the Bodyslimmers line in department and specialty stores and the successful launch of Weight Watchers in the mass market. These strong performances were partially offset by core Warner's, Olga and private label business decreasing $42.1 million or 10.9% compared to fiscal 1998 results, due to the loss of the customers previously mentioned. Bra market share in department and specialty stores for the year was 39.0% compared with 37.5% in 1998.
SPORTSWEAR AND ACCESSORIES DIVISION. Net revenues increased $147.5 million or 16.9% to $1,022.8 million in fiscal 1999 compared with $875.3 million in fiscal 1998. Net revenues contributed by the 1999 Authentic Fitness ($36.4), Chaps Canada ($5.7) and A.B.S. ($13.7) acquisitions amounted to $55.8 million. Excluding these acquisitions, net revenues increased $91.7 million or a strong 10.5%. The increase in net revenue was generated by the Calvin Klein Jeanswear Division, which increased $128.5 million or 25.7%, driven primarily by the men's and women's businesses. This increase was partially offset by Chaps, which decreased $33.6 million or 9.6% due primarily to the lost accounts mentioned above, which attributed to over $25.0 million of this decrease.
RETAIL STORES DIVISION. Net revenues increased $17.8 million or 13.7% in fiscal 1999. Net revenues in 1999 contributed by the Authentic Fitness ($4.2), Penhaligon's ($7.9) and IZKA ($0.2) acquisitions were $12.3 million, while the core Warnaco and Calvin Klein outlet stores increased $5.5 million or 4.2%.
Gross profit increased $151.4 million or 28.2% to $688.6 million in fiscal 1999 compared with $537.2 million in fiscal 1998. Gross margins improved 5.1% to 32.6% from 27.5%. Included in cost of goods sold in fiscal 1998 are restructuring and special charges of $21.8 million, other special items of $27.0 million (see discussion of Strategic Actions on page 18), the current year impact of the early adoption of SOP 98-5 of $40.8 million and a charge for an inventory adjustment related to production and inefficiency costs of $49.6 million. Excluding these 1998 items totaling $139.2 million, gross profit increased $12.2 million or 1.8%. Gross margins on this basis were 32.6% in 1999 compared with 34.7% in 1998. The decrease in gross margins from fiscal 1998 was caused by $30.0 million of additional markdowns required to: 1) liquidate inventory planned for lost customers; 2) reduce inventory levels in Intimate Apparel primarily from training new employees in start-up plants; and 3) address softness in the Calvin Klein Junior Jeans business; as well as $10.0 million additional plant start-up costs in the Company's new Intimate Apparel manufacturing facilities in Mexico.
INTIMATE APPAREL DIVISION. Gross profit (excluding restructuring and special items described above) decreased $56.5 million or 14.9% to $322.1 million in fiscal 1999 compared with $378.6 million in fiscal 1998. Gross margins on this basis were 34.1% in 1999 compared with 40.1% in 1998. The decrease in margins resulted from the incremental markdowns and additional plant start-up costs mentioned above. In addition, restructuring and special items described above were $123.3 million in fiscal 1998.
SPORTSWEAR AND ACCESSORIES DIVISION. Gross profit (excluding restructuring and special items described above) increased $67.4 million or 26.2% to $325.0 million in fiscal 1999 compared with $257.6 million in fiscal 1998. The increase in gross profit was due to the increase in net revenues mentioned above. Gross margins in 1999 were 31.8% compared with 29.4% in 1998 with the improvement due to sourcing efficiencies and cost reductions. In addition, restructuring and special items described above were $15.9 million in 1998.
RETAIL STORES DIVISION. Gross profit increased $1.0 million or 2.5% to $41.5 million in fiscal 1999 compared with $40.5 million in fiscal 1998. Gross margins in fiscal 1999 were 28.0% compared to 31.1% in fiscal 1998, with the decrease caused by additional markdowns to liquidate excess inventories.
Selling, administrative and general expenses increased $24.8 million to $476.4 million in fiscal 1999 compared with $451.6 million in fiscal 1998. Selling, administrative and general expenses as a percentage of sales were 22.5%in 1999 compared with 23.1% in 1998. Included in fiscal 1998 results are restructuring and special charges of $15.1 million and other special items of $31.3 million. Excluding restructuring and special charges in 1998, selling, administrative and general expenses were $405.2 million (20.8% of net revenues) in 1998. The increase in selling, administrative and general expenses as a percentage of net revenues, is primarily attributable to: 1) $16.0 million of non-operating incremental costs related to the Calvin Klein Jeans distribution consolidation; 2) a 30 basis-point increase of $15.4 in marketing spending to 5.6% of net revenues; and 3) incremental data processing costs related to Year 2000 conversion as well as the implementation of new systems.
OPERATING PROFIT
INTIMATE APPAREL DIVISION. Operating profit decreased $44.4 million or 22.5% to $152.6 million in fiscal 1999 compared with $197.0 million in fiscal 1998. This was attributable to the additional markdowns and plant start-up costs mentioned above. In addition, fiscal 1998 includes restructuring and special charges as outlined above of $72.4 million and the effect of adopting SOP 98-5 of $40.8 million and a charge for an inventory adjustment related to production and inefficiency costs of $49.6 million.
SPORTSWEAR AND ACCESSORIES DIVISION. Operating profit increased $11.9 million or 8.4% to $153.7 million in fiscal 1999 compared with $141.8 million in fiscal 1998. This was attributable to the 16.9% net revenue increase mentioned above, partially offset by the $16.0 million non-operating incremental cost related to the Calvin Klein Jeans distribution consolidation. In addition, restructuring and special charges as outlined above were $2.3 million in fiscal 1998.
RETAIL STORES DIVISION. Operating profit decreased $6.6 million to $9.0 million in fiscal 1999 from $15.6 million in fiscal 1998, with the decrease attributable to markdowns required to liquidate excess inventory. In addition, restructuring and special charges as outlined above were $4.8 million in fiscal 1998.
Interest expense increased $17.2 million to $81.0 million in fiscal 1999 compared with $63.8 million in fiscal 1998. The increase was caused primarily by additional borrowings to finance the Company's stock buyback program and its acquisitions in fiscal 1998 and 1999. (See Notes 2 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)
The income tax provision in fiscal 1999 was $33.4 million, or an overall effective tax rate of 25.5%. This compares to an income tax benefit in fiscal 1998 of $17.5 million consisting of a $7.7 million income tax expense on continuing operations and a $25.2 million income tax benefit on the cumulative effect of an accounting change, or an overall effective tax rate of 35.3%. The decrease in the effective tax rate from 35.3% in fiscal 1998 to 25.5% in fiscal 1999 was primarily due to a shift in the amount of income in
foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates and the impact of state income taxes. The Company has estimated United States net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $421.3 million at January 1, 2000 and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $33.7 million available to offset future taxable income. The net operating loss carryforwards expire in varying amounts between 2002 and 2018.
Income before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle improved $83.7 million to $97.8 million or $1.72 per diluted share in fiscal 1999 compared with $14.1 million or $0.22 per diluted share in fiscal 1998 due to the charges included in fiscal 1998 as mentioned above.
CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY
The Company's liquidity requirements arise primarily from its debt service and the funding of working capital needs, primarily inventory and accounts receivable and capital improvements programs. The Company's borrowing requirements are seasonal, with peak working capital needs generally arising at the end of the second quarter and during the third quarter of the fiscal year. The Company typically generates a substantial amount of its operating cash flow in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year, reflecting second and third quarter shipments and the sale of inventory built during the first half of the fiscal year.
There were no acquisitions in fiscal 2000. During fiscal 1999, the Company acquired Authentic Fitness Corporation, Penhaligon's Ltd., IZKA, A.B.S. by Allen Schwartz, and Chaps Canada.
During fiscal 1998, the Company acquired certain inventory and other assets as well as the sub-license to produce Calvin Klein children's jeans and jeanswear in Canada and Mexico. The total purchase price of these acquisitions was $53.1 million.
As discussed in the Notes 1 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company was not in compliance with certain covenants of its long-term debt agreements as of December 30, 2000, for which waivers were received through May 16, 2001. As the waivers do not extend through the end of fiscal 2001, the debt has been classified as a current liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The Company is currently in discussions with its lenders for permanent amendments to the agreements. If the Company is not successful, it would have to refinance its debt with others. The Company's ability to continue to operate as a going concern is dependent upon the outcome of the negotiations or upon its ability to refinance its debt. There can be no assurances that the Company will be able to successfully conclude such negotiations or secure alternative financing. As a result of the reclassification of its long-term debt to current, the Company has a working capital deficit of $1,433.7 million. Excluding the reclassification, working capital was $30.2 million.
Capital Resources. Cash used in operating activities in fiscal 2000 was $13.3 million compared to cash provided by operating activites of $10.0 million in fiscal 1999. The decrease in cash flow from operating activities from fiscal 1999 primarily resulted from: 1) the decrease in net income before cumulative effect of accounting change in fiscal 2000 ($428.9 million) and 2) the decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities ($171.2 million) partially offset by 3) a reduction in inventory of $177.6 million; 4) an increase in the provision for inventory write-downs of $173.0 million; 5) an improvement in accounts receivable of $171.2 million; 6) a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of $52.7 million related primarily to non-cash write-downs and 7) an increase in non-cash asset write-downs of $22.7 million.
Cash provided from operating activities in fiscal 1999 was $10.0 million compared to $334.7 million in fiscal 1998. The decrease in cash flow from operating activities from 1998 primarily resulted from 1) the decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $194.4 million relating to extended payment terms negotiated in fiscal 1998 and 2) the favorable impact of securitizing accounts receivable in 1998 of $145.1 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $102.1 million, $61.0 million and $46.5 million in fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998 respectively. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal 2000 reflects amortization of intangible assets acquired in fiscal 1999 and a significant increase in capital spending related to the Company's management information systems in fiscal 1999 and 2000.
The provision for receivable allowances was $262.6 million, $218.1 million and $171.3 million in fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998 respectively. The increase in fiscal 2000 over 1999 and 1999 over fiscal 1998 represents additional markdowns and allowances. The provision for inventory write-downs was $179.3 million in fiscal 2000, $6.2 million in fiscal 1999 and $25.4 million in fiscal 1998. The increase in fiscal
2000 compared to fiscal 1999 reflected the restructuring and special items in fiscal 2000 (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
Cash used in investing activities was $67.0 million in fiscal 2000 compared with $736.5 million in fiscal 1999. The decrease in fiscal 2000 relates primarily to cash expended of $625.5 million in fiscal 1999 in connection with the acquisitions of Authentic Fitness and A.B.S. In addition, fiscal 2000 was favorably impacted by the proceeds from the sale of the Company's equity investment in Interworld Corporation of $50.4 million. This was partially offset by the proceeds from sale/lease back transactions in fiscal 1999 of $23.2 million.
Cash used in investing activities was $736.5 million in fiscal 1999 compared with $222.8 million in fiscal 1998. The increase in fiscal 1999 compared to fiscal 1998 relates to an increase in acquisition of businesses of $572.4 million primarily related to the Authentic Fitness acquisition in December 1999.
Capital expenditures were $110.1 million, $109.1 million and $142.8 million in fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
Cash (used in) provided by financing activities was $82.1 million, $724.7 million and $(116.3) million in fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998 respectively. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2000 reflects the decrease in net borrowings under the acquisition loan facility of $584.9 million which was provided in fiscal 1999 to acquire Authentic Fitness. In addition, the decrease resulted from the increase in the payment of $35.9 million for deferred financing fees in connection with the Company's October 6, 2000 refinancing (the 'Refinancing'), partially offset by the Company's proceeds from the termination of interest rate swaps of $26.1 million in fiscal 2000. The Company paid $14.4 million of dividends in fiscal 2000 compared to $20.6 million in fiscal 1999 as the Company suspended its dividend payment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000. The increase in the cash provided from financing activities in fiscal 1999 compared to fiscal 1998 reflects borrowing of $586.2 million to acquire Authentic Fitness and an increase in net borrowings of $264.8 million to fund the Company's stock buy-back program and purchase of property, plant and equipment. During the year ended December 30, 2000, the Company repurchased no stock and paid cash dividends of $14.4 million. During the year ended January 1, 2000, the Company repurchased 6.2 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $142.0 million and paid cash dividends of $20.6 million. During the year ended January 2, 1999, the Company repurchased 4.8 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $133.0 million and paid cash dividends of $22.3 million. In exchange for shares received from option holders with a fair market value of $0.7 million, $2.6 million and $38.1 million in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively, the Company paid $0.7 million, $2.6 million and $38.1 million in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively, of withholding taxes on options that were exercised during the year.
On October 6, 2000, in connection with the Refinancing, the Company and the lenders under its credit facilities entered into an Agreement, Modification, Restatement and General Provision Agreement (the 'Amendment Agreement') and an Intercreditor Agreement. Pursuant to the Amendment Agreement, the Company's credit facilities were modified so that each now contains identical representations and warranties, covenants, mandatory prepayment obligations, and events of default. The Amendment Agreement also amended uncommitted credit facilities and those which matured prior to August 12, 2002 so that they each would be fully committed and mature on August 12, 2002 (maturities of credit facilities due after August 12, 2002 were unaffected).
The Amendment Agreement increased on a uniform basis and made the margins added to base rate or Eurodollar rate loans uniform under the credit facilities, based upon the debt rating of the Company. As of December 30, 2000, the applicable margin for the base rate advances under the credit facilities was 2.5% and the applicable margin for Eurodollar rate advances under the credit facilities was 3.5%. The Amendment Agreement also uniformly made the fee charged by lenders on letters of credit outstanding and the commitment fee charged by lenders based on the undrawn amount of the credit facilities consistent across the credit facilities. Each of these fees also vary based upon the Company's debt rating.
As part of the Refinancing, obligations under the credit facilities were guaranteed by The Warnaco Group, Inc., by all of its domestic subsidiaries and, on a limited basis, by all of its subsidiaries located in Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Mexico, Belgium. Hong Kong and
Barbados. The Company and each of such entities have granted liens on substantially all of its assets to secure these obligations. As a result of the Amendment Agreement, as of December 30, 2000, the Company has committed credit facilities in an aggregate amount of $2,609,237, all of which mature on or after August 12, 2002 with su",1
"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Overview
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, the Consolidated Financial Statements which begin on page 43.
Rouge Steel Company (“Rouge Steel”) is the primary operating subsidiary of Rouge Industries, Inc., a Delaware corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “Rouge Industries” or the “Company”). Rouge Steel is an integrated producer of high quality, flat rolled steel products consisting of hot rolled, cold rolled and galvanized steel. The Company’s products generally, and its value-added products specifically, are sold primarily to customers in the automotive industry. These customers have exacting quality, delivery and service requirements. The Company also sells its products to steel converters, service centers and other end users.
Other than Rouge Steel, Rouge Industries’ wholly-owned subsidiaries include QS Steel Inc. (“QS Steel”) and Eveleth Taconite Company (“Eveleth”). QS Steel holds minority ownership interests in two Michigan-based joint ventures. Eveleth holds a minority interest in Eveleth Mines LLC (“EVTAC”), a Minnesota-based iron ore mining and pellet producing operation. Rouge Steel holds a 50% interest in Double Eagle Steel Coating Company (“Double Eagle”), a Michigan based joint venture.
On February 1, 1999, an explosion and fire at the Rouge Complex Powerhouse (the “Powerhouse”) resulted in the interruption of the supply of electricity, process and heating steam, turbo air, mill water and other utilities to virtually all of the facilities of Rouge Steel. The loss of power resulted in a 93-day shutdown of Rouge Steel’s steel making facilities. Continuing business interruption and Powerhouse property damage expenses in 2000 and 2001, along with a partial settlement of the insurance claim in 2000 and the full settlement in 2001, affected the Company’s results of operations in those years. Consequently, comparisons between 2002 and 2001 and between 2001 and 2000 may not be meaningful.
During the mid-1990’s, the Company experienced a relatively stable market environment. Then in 1998, an unprecedented amount of steel imports began flooding the U.S. causing domestic steel prices to decline dramatically. Next, in 2000, natural gas prices began to rise causing a considerable increase in the Company’s costs of goods sold. In addition, in late 2001, a fire occurred at Double Eagle, the Company’s joint venture electrogalvanizing line, which caused that facility to lose production for nine months.
The Company continues to face difficult market conditions, although steel product prices in the spot market and demand for the Company’s products improved during 2002. The low prices during the past three years, the cash strain caused by the Powerhouse explosion and the Double Eagle fire and contractual issues related to the startup and operation of the new power plant caused significant operating losses and put considerable pressure on the Company’s liquidity. The Company responded to the liquidity deterioration by refinancing its revolving loan facility, procuring two subordinated credit facilities and selling or restructuring three joint ventures. The first subordinated credit facility was obtained in late 2001 and during 2002, the Company secured an additional $10 million loan, which is tied to a long-term supply contract with a raw material
supplier. Additionally, the Company has undertaken an aggressive cost reduction program and reduced capital expenditures in order to help conserve cash.
The Company’s liquidity is dependent on its operating performance (which is closely related to business conditions in the domestic steel industry), the implementation of operating and capital cost reduction programs, receipt of proceeds from the Double Eagle insurance claim, the impact of the tariffs imposed in response to the Bush Administration’s Section 201 relief, and its sources of financing. The Company depends on borrowings to fund operations. In the event that market conditions deteriorate, causing operating losses to continue, and the Company is unable to secure additional financing sources to fund its operations, it may be required to seek bankruptcy protection or commence liquidation or other administrative proceedings.
The following table summarizes the annual raw steel capacity, raw steel production, utilization rates and finished shipment information for the domestic steel industry (as reported by the American Iron and Steel Institute) and for Rouge Steel for the years from 2000 through 2002:
The cyclicality of the steel industry and the domestic economy affects the Company’s steel product prices. To protect itself from the volatile nature of prices in the domestic steel industry, the Company sells more than one half of its steel products pursuant to fixed price contracts, under which prices are typically set annually. In 2003, a significant portion of the Company’s contract prices will increase over 2002. The Company’s financial results are significantly affected by relatively small (on a percentage basis) variations in the realized prices for its products. For example, Rouge Industries shipped 2.7 million net tons of steel products and recorded total sales of $1,127.0 million during 2002, implying an average realized price per ton of $416. A one percent increase or decrease in this implied average realized price during 2002 would, on a pro forma basis, have resulted in an increase or decrease in total sales and pre-tax income of approximately $11 million. The competitive pressures in the domestic steel industry affect the prices that the Company can charge for its products and, ultimately, its profitability. These pressures could limit the Company’s ability to obtain price increases or could lead to a further decline in prices which could have a materially adverse effect on Rouge Industries.
Prices in the domestic steel industry have been volatile for a number of years. In 1994, prices reached the highest level since 1988. By mid-1995, however, prices began to soften
despite the strong demand for steel. In 1996, there was some strengthening of prices but in 1997, prices declined. When unprecedented levels of imports saturated the U.S. in 1998, prices declined dramatically. In late 1999 and early 2000, prices made a modest recovery, but never reached the early-1998 levels. By the second half of 2000, prices again declined considerably. Despite operating losses by nearly all of the domestic integrated steel producers, prices continued to deteriorate throughout 2001. The Company’s average realized price is still not as high as it was in 1998. Spot market prices improved in 2002, but changes in price still depend on factors such as the impact of the Bush Administration’s Section 201 relief and whether there will be further consolidation in the steel industry. Spot market prices reached their peak in the third quarter of 2002 and they have deteriorated since that time.
Total Sales. The Company’s total sales are a function of net tons shipped, prices and mix of products. The following table sets forth the percentage of the Company’s steel product revenues represented by each of its product types for each of the years from 2000 through 2002:
Costs of Goods Sold. The principal elements constituting Rouge Industries’ costs of goods sold are raw materials, labor and energy.
The major raw materials and energy used by the Company in its production process are coke, iron ore pellets, steel scrap, natural gas, electricity, steam, oxygen and nitrogen. Iron ore pellets were purchased from EVTAC pursuant to a pellet purchase agreement which expired in 2002. The Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Eveleth, continues to hold a 45% interest in EVTAC, but beginning in 2003, the Company will purchase all of its pellets from Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.
Rouge Steel’s hourly production and maintenance employees are represented by the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, UAW (the “UAW”) and are working under a labor contract which expires on August 1, 2004.
The Company uses between 16 million and 19 million MMBTUs of natural gas per year in its blast furnaces, hot strip mill and cold mills. The cost of natural gas increased dramatically during 2000 and stayed high in 2001 and 2002.
Outside processing costs, which are principally costs for value-added processing that the Company cannot perform at Rouge Steel’s integrated facility, have always been an element of the Company’s costs of goods sold. The Company’s joint ventures increased the outside processing and related costs. However, Rouge Industries believes that the incremental revenue generated
from additional sales of value-added products produced by the joint ventures has exceeded such cost increases.
Double Eagle Insurance Claim
On December 15, 2001, a major fire at Double Eagle halted production. The Company and its joint venture partner, United States Steel Corporation, rebuilt Double Eagle and returned the facility to production in September 2002.
The Company’s insurance program provides coverage for damage to property destroyed, interruption of business operations and expenditures incurred to minimize the period and total cost of disruption to operations. The Company evaluates its potential insurance recoveries in two areas:
1.
Damage to Double Eagle property as a result of the fire - Non-capitalizable costs for repairs are being expensed as incurred, with related estimated insurance recoveries recorded as they are considered to be probable, up to the amount of the actual costs incurred. Capitalizable costs are being capitalized as incurred. Gains from proceeds relating to capitalizable repair costs will be recorded when the claim is settled.
2.
Rouge Steel business interruption costs - Costs to coat steel at toll processors are expensed as incurred, with related estimated insurance recoveries recorded as they are considered to be probable.
Pursuant to the accounting methodology described above, during 2002, the Company recorded insurance recoveries with respect to the Double Eagle fire of $31.4 million. At December 31, 2002, the Company had a deferred insurance recovery liability with respect to the Double Eagle fire of $13.9 million, which represents advances from insurers in excess of recoverable costs recorded. The deferred insurance recovery was recorded in connection with capitalized repair costs and will be recognized in income when the claim is settled. Recoverable costs are net of a deductible of $7.5 million and reserves of $3.4 million at December 31, 2002. Advances from the insurance carriers total $33.3 million through December 31, 2002. Additional advances of $10.0 million were received through February 5, 2003.
Powerhouse Explosion and Insurance Claim
On February 1, 1999, an explosion and fire at the Powerhouse resulted in the interruption of the supply of electricity, process and heating steam, turbo air, mill water and other utilities to virtually all of the facilities of Rouge Steel. The loss of power resulted in a 93-day shutdown of Rouge Steel’s steel making facilities. The Powerhouse is owned 60% by Rouge Steel and 40% by Ford. Ford was responsible for the day-to-day management, operation and maintenance of the Powerhouse.
The Company’s insurance program relating to the Powerhouse provided coverage for damage to property destroyed, interruption of business operations, including profit recovery, and expenditures incurred to minimize the period and total cost of disruption to operations.
During 2000, the Company received cash proceeds representing a partial settlement with its insurers regarding Rouge Steel first-party property damage and business interruption costs
through March 31, 2000. The partial settlement covered all of the first-party property damage and substantially all aspects of the business interruption claim, including profit on lost sales, operating inefficiencies caused by the loss and costs to mitigate the claim.
During 2001, the Company received cash proceeds representing final settlement with its insurers regarding Rouge Steel’s insurable first-party and Powerhouse property damage and business interruption costs. As a result of the settlement, the Company recorded $81.5 million of insurance recoveries in 2001, of which $63.2 million represents gain on the net book value of the Powerhouse property destroyed. Total recoveries and final proceeds of the claim amount to $343.3 million.
Based on current engineering information and applicable legal requirements, the Company has evaluated the amount and probability of certain ancillary costs relating to the explosion, principally cleanup, demolition and abatement activities. In 2001, as a result of these obligations with respect to its share of expenditures required to mitigate safety and environmental risks associated with the final disposition of the Powerhouse, the Company recorded an accrual of $14.6 million for these anticipated costs. As of December 31, 2002, the Company has spent $9.2 million for such costs.
Results of Operations
Year Ended December 31, 2002 versus Year Ended December 31, 2001
Total Sales. Total sales increased 22.0% in 2002 to $1,127.0 million from $923.5 million in 2001, an increase of $203.5 million. The increase in total sales in 2002 was caused principally by higher steel product prices and shipments. Average realized revenue per ton increased 9.7% in 2002 to $416 from $379 per ton in 2001, an increase of $37 per ton. The increase in average realized revenue per ton was the result of considerably higher steel prices in 2002. The increase in steel prices was due to the impact of the reduction in steelmaking capacity resulting from the closure of bankrupt steel companies in late 2001 and, to a lesser extent, the tariffs imposed by the Bush Administration pursuant to Section 201 of the U.S. Trade Act of 1974. Steel product shipments increased 11.0% in 2002 to 2,707,000 net tons from 2,440,000 net tons in 2001, an increase of 267,000 net tons.
Costs and Expenses. Total costs and expenses increased 8.1% in 2002 to $1,204.0 million from $1,114.3 million in 2001, an increase of $89.7 million. Costs of goods sold increased 8.9% in 2002 to $1,162.2 million from $1,067.7 million in 2001, an increase of $94.5 million. The increase in costs of goods sold was primarily due to the higher shipments discussed above, costs associated with the Double Eagle fire and increased costs for health care and other fringe benefits, partially offset by an effective cost reduction effort, the absence of a temporary blast furnace shutdown, lower natural gas prices, lower costs related to the Powerhouse explosion and improved productivity in primary operations. The Company’s blast furnaces set an annual production record in 2002. Costs of goods sold in 2002 was 103.1% of total sales, down from 115.6% of total sales in 2001 primarily as a result of price increases. Selling and administrative expenses decreased 17.2% in 2002 to $17.1 million from $20.6 million in 2001, a decrease of $3.5 million. The decrease in selling and administrative expenses was the result of a reduction in the Michigan Single Business Tax expense due to recently passed legislation permitting tax credits for Michigan iron ore consumption as well as lower professional service costs associated with the Powerhouse explosion insurance claim in 2001. The Company’s operating cost per net
ton shipped decreased 2.6% in 2002 to $445 per net ton from $457 per net ton in 2001, a decrease of $12 per net ton. The decrease was primarily the result of favorable economics on certain utilities, materials and fuels and the Company’s effective cost reduction effort. The Company has embarked on a plan to implement cost reduction projects throughout the organization.
Operating Loss. The operating loss decreased 59.6% in 2002 to $77.0 million from $190.7 million in 2001, a decrease of $113.7 million. The decrease is primarily the result of significantly higher steel product selling prices, improved productivity and aggressive cost reductions, partially offset by costs associated with the Double Eagle fire and higher health care costs.
Interest Expense. Interest expense increased 18.5% in 2002 to $10.4 million from $8.8 million in 2001, an increase of $1.6 million. The increase in interest expense was the result of higher debt in 2002 resulting primarily from operating losses. The average debt balance in 2002 was $168.6 million compared to $100.6 million in 2001.
Insurance Recovery. The Company recognized $31.4 million of income in 2002 for insurance recoveries related to the Double Eagle fire. It recognized $81.5 million of income for insurance recoveries related to the Powerhouse explosion in 2001. Insurance recoveries in 2002 were $50.1 million lower than in 2001.
Other - Net. Other-net increased in 2002 to $6.0 million from $2.1 million in 2001, an increase of $3.9 million. The increase is due to the Company’s sale of its joint venture interest in TWB Company, L.L.C., which caused a writeoff of $4.5 million.
Income Tax Benefit. An income tax benefit of $2.5 million was recorded in 2002 as a result of a refund relating to the implementation of a provision in the “Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002” allowing for a five-year carryback of net operating losses. In 2001, the Company did not record an income tax benefit or provision.
Year Ended December 31, 2001 versus Year Ended December 31, 2000
Total Sales. Total sales decreased 16.0% in 2001 to $923.5 million from $1,099.8 million in 2000, a decrease of $176.3 million. The decrease in total sales in 2001 was caused principally by lower steel product prices and shipments. Average realized revenue per ton decreased 11.5% in 2001 to $379 per ton from $428 per ton in 2000, a decrease of $49 per ton. The decrease in average realized revenue per ton was the result of dramatically lower steel prices and, to a lesser extent, an unfavorable sales mix in 2001. Steel product shipments decreased 5.1% in 2001 to 2,440,000 net tons from 2,570,000 net tons in 2000, a decrease of 130,000 net tons. Rouge Industries’ shipments were lower in 2001 because of the weak demand for steel products in the market.
Costs and Expenses. Total costs and expenses decreased 12.0% in 2001 to $1,114.3 million from $1,266.6 million in 2000, a decrease of $152.3 million. Costs of goods sold decreased 9.8% in 2001 to $1,067.7 million from $1,183.2 million in 2000, a decrease of $115.5 million. The decrease in costs of goods sold was primarily due to the lower shipments discussed above, lower costs associated with the Powerhouse explosion, an effective cost reduction effort and lower utility costs partially offset by higher natural gas prices. Costs of goods sold in 2001 was 115.6% of total sales, up from 107.6% of total sales in 2000. Depreciation and amortization decreased
54.2% in 2001 to $26.0 million from $56.7 million in 2000, a decrease of $30.7 million. The decrease in depreciation and amortization is attributable to lower amortization of the cost of the temporary steam boilers and electrical distribution systems installed to provide the Company with steam and electricity after the Powerhouse explosion. The temporary facilities, which were placed into service in the second quarter of 1999, were amortized over the period from the second quarter of 1999 through December 31, 2000. Selling and administrative expenses decreased 22.8% in 2001 to $20.6 million from $26.7 million in 2000, a decrease of $6.1 million . The decrease in selling and administrative expenses was the result of considerably lower fees paid to professional service firms to assist with the Powerhouse explosion insurance claim, lower salaried labor costs and lower spending by administrative departments resulting from an aggressive cost reduction effort. The Company’s operating cost per net ton shipped decreased 7.3% in 2001 to $457 per net ton from $493 per net ton in 2000, a decrease of $36 per net ton. The decrease was primarily the result of lower spending from an aggressive cost reduction effort, lower costs related to the Powerhouse explosion, lower depreciation and amortization expense and lower selling and administrative expenses.
Operating Loss. The operating loss increased 14.3% in 2001 to $190.7 million from $166.8 million in 2000, an increase of $23.9 million. The increase is primarily the result of significantly lower steel product selling prices and higher natural gas costs, partially offset by lower spending from an aggressive cost reduction effort, lower costs related to the Powerhouse explosion, lower depreciation and amortization expense and lower selling and administrative expenses.
Interest Expense. Interest expense increased 69.2% in 2001 to $8.8 million from $5.2 million in 2000, an increase of $3.6 million. The increase in interest expense was the result of higher debt in 2001 resulting primarily from operating losses. The average debt balance in 2001 was $100.6 million compared to $55.8 million in 2000.
Insurance Recovery. Insurance recovery decreased 10.4% in 2001 to $81.5 million from $91.0 million in 2000, a decrease of $9.5 million. The Company’s insurance program provides coverage for damage to property destroyed, interruption of business operations and expenses incurred to minimize the period of disruption incurred as a result of an insurable event. The Company records insurance recovery for actual and anticipated insurance proceeds. The amount in 2001 represents the final settlement of the Powerhouse insurance claim. The amount in 2000 represents $84.3 million related to the Powerhouse explosion and $6.7 million related to an incident that occurred at the basic oxygen furnace (“BOF”) in early 2000. There was no insurance recovery recorded for the December 15, 2001 fire at Double Eagle Steel Coating Company (“Double Eagle”), the Company’s electrogalvanizing joint venture. The expenses incurred as a result of the Double Eagle fire did not exceed the Company’s $7.5 million insurance deductible during 2001. The Company expects to record significant insurance recovery and related costs in 2002 as a result of the Double Eagle fire.
Income Tax Provision. The Company did not record an income tax provision or benefit in 2001 compared to an income tax provision of $37.3 million in 2000. The change is the result of the Company’s decision to record a non-cash valuation reserve against its deferred tax assets in 2000. In evaluating the need for a reserve, the Company considered the likelihood of its ability to realize the benefit of its deferred tax assets given the continuing uncertainty of the domestic steel market and the Company’s future profitability. The Company will continue to assess the valuation reserve and to the extent it is determined that it is not necessary, the reserve will be subsequently adjusted.
Equity in Unconsolidated Subsidiaries. Equity in unconsolidated subsidiaries increased in 2001 to $8.1 million from $1.9 million in 2000, an increase of $6.2 million. The increase is attributable to improved performance at Eveleth Mines LLC, the Company’s 45% owned iron ore mine and pellet producer, and the adjustment of the Company’s basis in Shiloh of Michigan, L.L.C. (“Shiloh of Michigan”). Rouge Industries transferred its interest in Shiloh of Michigan to an affiliate of Shiloh Industries, Inc., the Company’s partner in the Shiloh of Michigan joint venture. This agreement resulted in the Company recording a $1.8 million non-cash gain relating to the reversal of previously recorded losses in excess of the Company’s basis in Shiloh of Michigan.
Powerhouse Explosion Insurance Claim. The insurance claim related to the February 1, 1999 explosion and fire at the Powerhouse was settled in 2001. Costs of Goods Sold includes property damage and business interruption expenses of $23.7 million and $38.6 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Depreciation and Amortization Expense includes an additional $32.2 million in 2000 related to the temporary steam boilers, electrical distribution equipment and other temporary facilities. The aggregate effect of Powerhouse-related items on operating loss was $23.7 million and $72.0 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
During the mid-1990’s, the Company experienced a relatively stable market environment. Then in 1998, an unprecedented amount of steel imports began flooding the U.S. causing domestic steel prices to decline dramatically. Next, in 2000, natural gas prices began to rise causing a considerable increase in the Company’s costs of goods sold. In addition, in late 2001, a fire occurred at Double Eagle, the Company’s joint venture electrogalvanizing line, which caused that facility to lose production for nine months.
The Company continues to face difficult market conditions, although steel product prices in the spot market and demand for the Company’s products improved during 2002. The low prices during the past three years, the cash strain caused by the Powerhouse explosion and the Double Eagle fire and contractual issues related to the contractual issues related to the startup and operation of the new power plant caused significant operating losses and put considerable pressure on the Company’s liquidity. The Company responded to the liquidity deterioration by refinancing its revolving loan facility, procuring two subordinated credit facilities and selling or restructuring three joint ventures. During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company’s borrowings increased from $145.5 million to $186.2 million.
The Company’s liquidity is dependent on operating performance (which is closely related to business conditions in the domestic steel industry), the implementation of operating and capital cost reduction programs, receipt of proceeds from the Double Eagle insurance claim, the impact of the tariffs imposed in response to the Section 201 filings, and its sources of financing. The Company depends on borrowings to fund operations. In the event that market conditions deteriorate, causing operating losses to continue, and the Company is unable to secure additional financing sources to fund its operations, it may be required to seek bankruptcy protection or commence liquidation or other administrative proceedings.
Cash and cash equivalents on December 31, 2002 totaled $2.6 million compared to $3.2 million on December 31, 2001, a decrease of $600,000. Cash used for operating activities was offset by cash provided by financing activities during 2002.
Cash Flows from Operating Activities. Net cash used for operating activities was $31.1 million in 2002 compared to $59.8 million in 2001. The net decrease of $28.7 million was comprised primarily of lower net loss and deferred insurance recovery partially offset by higher accounts receivable caused by the increase in the volume and price of the steel sold by the Company and lower accounts payable.
Capital Expenditures. Cash used for capital expenditures, including investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries, was $23.1 million in 2002 compared to $23.3 million in 2001, a decrease of $200,000. The decrease is the result of an effort to reduce capital spending in order to conserve cash offset by costs incurred to rebuild Double Eagle. In 2003, the Company plans to spend approximately $25 million on capital items, which will be generally directed at maintaining plant efficiency and product quality.
Credit Facilities. The Company has a $200 million revolving loan agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) which expires on March 13, 2004. Rouge Steel is the borrower under the Credit Agreement and Rouge Industries is a guarantor. The Credit Agreement is secured by substantially all the assets of the Company. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are limited to specified percentages of receivables and inventories. There is one financial covenant in the Credit Agreement, which is an excess availability minimum of $25 million. There is also a subjective acceleration clause in the Credit Agreement which causes the Company to classify its debt outstanding under the Credit Agreement as current. At December 31, 2002, the Company’s receivables and inventories supported availability under the Credit Agreement of $156.2 million, of which it could borrow up to $129.9 million without a covenant default. The Company had borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement of $101.2 million as of December 31, 2002. The Credit Agreement bears an unused line fee of 0.375%. The revolving loans provided for under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at the option of the Company, at a rate equal to either (i) the base rate, which is the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate, plus a margin ranging from 0.25% to 1.00% depending on excess availability under the Credit Agreement during the prior quarter, or (ii) the LIBOR rate plus a margin ranging from 2.25% to 3.00% depending on the Company’s excess availability under the Credit Agreement during the prior quarter.
During 2002, the Company secured a $10 million loan from Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (the “Cliffs Facility”). The Cliffs Facility expires on June 30, 2007 and bears interest at 10% per year. The Cliffs Facility is subordinate to the Credit Agreement, has a second security interest in the accounts receivable and inventory of the Company and contains cross default provisions with the Credit Agreement.
The Company also has a $75 million credit facility (the “Ford Facility”). The Ford Facility, expires on June 30, 2004 and bears interest at approximately the same rate as the Credit Agreement. The Ford Facility is subordinate to the Credit Agreement and the Cliffs Facility, has a third security interest in the accounts receivable and inventory of the Company and contains cross default provisions with the Credit Agreement.
Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments. The Company has certain obligations with various parties that include commitments to make future payments. Such obligations are presented below.
(1)
Includes $101.2 million of debt outstanding under the Credit Agreement. This amount is classified as an obligation with payments due in less than one year because of a subjective acceleration clause in the Credit Agreement.
(2)
Includes $75.0 million of debt outstanding under the Ford Facility and $10.0 million of debt outstanding under the Cliffs Facility.
(3)
Includes the Company’s operating lease for its Waste Oxide Reclamation Facility and mobile equipment rentals.
(4)
Includes $75.2 million per year until 2006 for minimum pellet purchases and $263.2 million in 2007 to recognize a five-year aggregate minimum pellet purchase obligation, $9.4 million per year until 2011 for minimum oxygen purchases, $1.3 million per year until 2011 for minimum nitrogen purchases, and $972,000 per year until 2005 for minimum hydrogen purchases.
(1)
Includes $1.0 million to the State of Michigan Bureau of Workers’ Compensation and $300,000 as collateral under the Company’s automobile insurance program.
(2)
Includes amount guaranteed to a bank in favor of Delaco Processing, L.L.C., a 49% owned joint venture.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company has certain off-balance sheet arrangements that affect its financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. These arrangements are described below.
Delaco Steel Processing Guarantee. Rouge Industries and Delaco Steel Corporation (the “Delaco Guarantors”) have agreed to jointly and severally guarantee a $2,223,000 credit facility for Delaco Steel Processing (the “Delaco Guarantee”). As of December 31, 2002, Delaco Steel Processing, the Company’s 49% owned steel slitting and blanking joint venture, had borrowings of $1,263,000 outstanding under its credit facility. The Delaco Guarantors agreed to the Delaco Guarantee in order to induce the bank to make a loan to Delaco Steel Processing. The obligations under the guarantee remain in effect until Delaco Steel Processing repays all amounts due to the bank. In the event that Delaco Steel Processing does not have sufficient funding to meet its obligations as they become due, the Delaco Guarantors would be required to fund such obligations. The Delaco Guarantors also have agreed to jointly and severally insure that Delaco Steel Processing maintains a positive Net Worth at all times. There is no collateral with respect to the Delaco Guarantee, nor are there any recourse provisions that would enable the Company to recover any amounts paid under the Delaco Guarantee.

Executive Overview
Review of 2011
The year 2011 has been challenging for us. As we began 2011 the moratoriums on drilling in the Gulf of Mexico had been lifted but there had been no permits issued for new deepwater drilling to any company. We had two wells out of a scheduled four wells producing at our Telemark Hub and the prospects of receiving permits for the next two wells was uncertain. The drilling of two additional wells at our Gomez Hub had been deferred to future periods because of the moratoriums. Clearly, the moratoriums had impacted us.
On March 18, 2011 we received the third deepwater drilling permit granted by the BOEM after the end of the moratoriums and on March 31, 2011, we once again began drilling at our Telemark Hub. During the remainder of 2011 we received drilling permits for a second well at our Clipper project and our fourth well at our Telemark Hub. Other permits for workovers, side tracks, development and exploration at other projects have also been received in 2011. In summary, the total uncertainty surrounding permits in the Gulf of Mexico that ushered in 2011 had been replaced by a more reasonable flow and certainty for the permitting process. The deepwater Gulf of Mexico has once again opened for business.
We focus on deepwater drilling, development and production. While we had no ownership in the Macondo well and no direct costs associated with the Macondo well, we have been and continue to be negatively impacted by the drilling moratoriums. New rules and regulations have made it more expensive than in the past for certain development operations. Acquisition of leases has become more expensive. The permitting process and the subsequent drilling now take longer. While greater certainty is present as we enter 2012 than when we entered 2011, that certainty includes longer permitting times, more rules and regulations and higher costs. See further discussion below under “Risks and Uncertainties.”
Total proved reserves as of December 31, 2011 are 118.9 MMBoe. Our proved reserves in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico account for 62% of our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2011. Our proved reserves on the Gulf of Mexico Outer Continental Shelf account for 2% of our total proved reserves with the remaining 36% in the North Sea. From year-end 2010 to year-end 2011, we increased our proved developed reserve percentage from 18.8% to 23.0%.
Our revenues from oil and natural gas are highly dependent on the underlying commodity prices. During 2011 domestic oil prices hit a high of $113.93 per Bbl and a low of $75.67 per Bbl. Natural gas prices were also volatile, ranging from a high of $4.85 per MMBtu to a low of $2.99 per MMBtu. During 2011 our realized oil price per barrel increased 36% to $98.98 compared to 2010, and natural gas prices decreased 1% to $4.77 per Mcf in the same period. Coupled with the overall 17% increase in production in 2011, our oil and gas revenues rose 64% in 2011. Oil continues to represent the majority of our production accounting for 68% of our volumes on a BOE basis and 88% of our oil and gas revenues.
In 2011, we incurred $436.9 million in capital expenditures. With these expenditures we accomplished the following:
•
In February 2011, we began production from MC Block 754, which produces into the Gomez Hub.
•
Continued the drilling and completion activities of the third and fourth wells at our Telemark Hub. The third well, the MC 941 A-2, was placed on production in August 2011 and the fourth well, the MC 942 A-3, was placed on production in February 2012;
•
Completed and tested two wells at our Clipper property. Both of these wells are scheduled for production in the latter part of 2012 after installation of the pipeline servicing the wells;
•
Acquired three deepwater exploration licenses offshore Israel;
•
Continued construction of the Octabuoy floating production facility that will serve our Cheviot project in the North Sea;
•
Increased total production by 17% to 9.0 MMBoe.
We funded our 2011 activities through a combination of cash provided by operating activities, new equity and debt financings, the sale or conveyance of economic interests in selected properties and financing
Index to Financial Statements
arrangements with our hedge counterparties and suppliers. During 2011, cash provided by operating activities was $197.1 million. We raised $149.9 million from a preferred stock offering, $59.4 million from a debt financing and $91.0 million from the Titan assets - Term Loan Facility. We sold $85.3 million of limited-term overriding royalty interests and net profit interests and had net receipts of $67.1 million from the pre-funding of oil hedges. The details of these transactions are discussed below in Liquidity and Capital Resources.
From 2009 to 2011 we financed significant portions of our development program with transactions entered into with our suppliers and their affiliates. We have conveyed to certain suppliers net profits interests in our Telemark Hub, Gomez Hub and Clipper oil and gas properties in exchange for development services. We have also negotiated with certain other vendors involved in the development of the Telemark Hub and Clipper to partially defer payments for a period of twelve months. Development of the Cheviot Hub in the U.K. North Sea continues. We have arranged with the constructor of the floating production facility to defer $228.9 million of payments until 2013. These financial arrangements have preserved our current cash and will allow us to pay vendors from the proceeds of future production. (See Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.)
2012 Operational Objectives
In the Gulf of Mexico, a primary goal was bringing to production the fourth well at our Telemark Hub. This was accomplished on February 26, 2012. We will continue workover operations on two other wells at the Telemark Hub in an effort to continue to increase production from this location. Later in 2012, we expect to complete a pipeline that will bring to production the two wells at our Clipper project. These two wells were completed and tested during 2011. Workover operations are scheduled at our Gomez Hub and additionally, we are planning to drill of two new Gomez wells starting in late 2012. In the North Sea we are scheduled to begin a development operation at our Blythe location late in 2012. We will continue the construction of our Octabuoy floating production facility with construction completion scheduled in 2013. In Israel we are scheduled to begin drilling our first well during the second quarter of 2012. Additional opportunities in our three core areas plus other opportunities in new areas may be pursued based on available capital, partners and personnel. All of our 2012 development plans in the Gulf of Mexico are dependent upon receiving deepwater drilling, pipeline, completion and other permits from the BOEM. While we believe it is likely that we will receive permits in 2012 allowing us to execute our plans, there is no assurance that the permits will be received in time to impact our 2012 results of operations.
Risks and Uncertainties
Since May 2010 when the federal government imposed the first of a series of moratoriums on drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, we have faced unparalleled difficulties in obtaining permits to continue our development programs. Prior to the moratoriums, we anticipated developing and bringing to production three additional wells at our Telemark Hub and two additional wells at our Gomez Hub by the end of 2010. It has taken until the first quarter of 2012 for us to bring to production all of the three additional wells at the Telemark Hub and, during the third quarter of 2011, the two wells planned for the Gomez Hub were postponed to late 2012/early 2013.
The new wells that have been placed on production have taken longer to complete and bring to production than originally planned and one of them has not produced at rates that were previously projected. In addition, we have incurred capital and operating costs higher than we expected primarily due to additional regulations imposed since the Deepwater Horizon incident and the requirement to perform sidetracks on two of the wells. The new wells helped us achieve production growth in 2011, and we forecast production and operating cash flow growth in 2012 as development activity continues. While cash flows were lower than previously projected due to lower than expected production rates, delays in bringing on new production and higher capital costs, we continued our development operations by supplementing our cash flows from operating activities with funds raised through various transactions (see the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.) Our planned operations for 2012 reflect our expectations for production based on actual production history, new production expected to be brought online, the development delays at Telemark and Gomez Hubs discussed above, the deferral of certain capital expenditures, the continuation of commodity prices near current levels, the higher anticipated costs associated with maintaining existing production and bringing new production online, and the higher cost of servicing our additional financing and other obligations.
Index to Financial Statements As of December 31, 2011, we had a working capital deficit of $347.5 million. To preserve our development momentum in the negative working capital environment that we experienced throughout 2011, we have increased our term loans, issued convertible perpetual preferred stock, granted net profits interests (NPI’s) to certain of our vendors, sold NPI’s and dollar-denominated overriding royalty interests (Overrides) in our properties to investors, and we have entered into prepaid swaps against our future production that provided cash proceeds to us at closing. We have negotiated with the constructor of the hull of the Octabuoy in China to defer the majority of our payments until the hull is ready to be moved to the North Sea, currently scheduled to be during 2013. A similar arrangement is in place for the Octabuoy topside equipment, which is being constructed by the same company in China.
As operator of all of our projects that require cash commitments within the next twelve months and beyond, we retain significant control over the development concept and its timing. We consider the control and flexibility afforded by operating our properties under development to be instrumental to our business plan and strategy. To manage our liquidity, we have delayed certain capital commitments, and within certain constraints, we can continue to conserve capital by further delaying or eliminating future capital commitments. While postponing or eliminating capital projects will delay or reduce future cash flows from scheduled new production, this control and flexibility is one method by which we can match, on a temporary basis, our capital commitments to our available capital resources.
Our cash flow projections are highly dependent upon numerous assumptions including the timing and rates of production from our new wells, the sales prices we realize for our oil and natural gas, the cost to develop and produce our reserves, our ability to monetize our properties and future production through asset sales and financial derivatives, and a number of other factors, some of which are beyond our control. Our inability to increase near-term production levels and generate sufficient liquidity through the actions noted above could result in our inability to meet our obligations as they come due which would have a material adverse affect on us. In the event we do not achieve the projected production and cash flow increases, we will attempt to fund any short-term liquidity needs through other financing sources; however, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future if required to meet any short-term liquidity needs. We believe we can continue to meet our obligations for at least the next twelve months through a combination of cash flow from operations, continuing to sell or assign interests in our properties and selling forward our production through the financial derivatives markets, and if necessary, further delaying certain development activities.
Despite our anticipated production growth, we remain highly leveraged. Servicing our debt and other long-term obligations will continue to place significant constraints on us and makes us vulnerable to adverse economic and industry conditions. Specifically, certain of our financing and derivative transactions require us to make payments in future periods from the proceeds (or net profits) from the sale of production. While these financing transactions have enabled us to continue the development of our properties and meet current operating needs, they will significantly burden the future net cash flows from our production until these obligations are satisfied. (See Note 7, “Other Long-term Obligations,” and Note 13, “Derivative Instruments and Risk Management Activities” for further details.)
Our estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves and the estimated future net revenues from such reserves are based upon various assumptions, including assumptions relating to oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. The estimation process requires significant assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. Therefore, these estimates are inherently imprecise and the quality and reliability of this data can vary. Estimates of our oil and natural gas reserves and the costs and timing associated with developing these reserves are subject to change, and may differ materially from our actual results. A substantial portion of our total proved reserves are undeveloped and recognition of such reserves requires us to expect that capital will be available to fund their development. The size of our operations and our capital expenditures budget limit the number of properties that we can develop in any given year and we intend to continue to develop these reserves, but there is no assurance we will be successful. Development of these reserves may not yield the expected results, or the development may be delayed or the costs may exceed our estimates, any of which may materially affect our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, the quantity of proved reserves that we report, and our ability to meet the requirements of our financing obligations.
A substantial portion of our current production is concentrated among relatively few wells located offshore in the Gulf of Mexico and in the North Sea, which are characterized by production declines more rapid than
Index to Financial Statements
those of conventional onshore properties. As a result, we are particularly vulnerable to a near-term severe impact resulting from unanticipated complications in the development of, or production from, any single material well or infrastructure installation, including lack of sufficient capital, delays in receiving necessary drilling and operating permits, increased regulation, reduced access to equipment and services, mechanical or operational failures, and bad weather. Any unanticipated significant disruption to, or decline in, our current production levels or prolonged negative changes in commodity prices or operating cost levels could have a materially adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, the quantity of proved reserves that we report, and our ability to meet our commitments as they come due.
Oil and natural gas development and production in the Gulf of Mexico are regulated by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (“BOEM”) and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (“BSEE”) of the Department of the Interior, collectively, formerly known as the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement. Our near-term operating and development plans in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as our longer-term business plan, are dependent upon receiving regulatory approvals for deepwater drilling and other permits required by the BSEE. Delays in the permitting process directly impact the timing of our development and production activities, and can materially affect our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and the quantity of proved reserves that we report.
We cannot predict future changes in laws and regulations governing oil and gas operations in the Gulf of Mexico. New regulations issued since the Deepwater Horizon incident in 2010 have changed the way we conduct our business and increased our costs of developing and commissioning new assets. We incurred additional costs in 2010 from the deepwater drilling moratoriums, subsequent drilling permit delays and additional inspection and commissioning costs. Some of these additional costs continued into 2011 and are projected to continue into 2012. Should there be additional significant future regulations or additional statutory limitations, they could require further changes in the way we conduct our business, further increase our costs of doing business or ultimately prohibit us from drilling for or producing hydrocarbons in the Gulf of Mexico. Additionally, we cannot influence or predict if or how the governments of other countries in which we operate may modify their regulatory regimes from time to time.
As an independent oil and gas producer, our revenue, profitability, cash flows, proved reserves and future rate of growth are substantially dependent on prevailing prices for oil and natural gas. Historically, the energy markets have been very volatile, and we expect such price volatility to continue. Any extended decline in oil or gas prices could have a materially adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, the quantities of oil and gas reserves that we can economically produce, and may restrict our ability to obtain additional financing or to meet the contractual requirements of our debt and other obligations.
Results of Operations
For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 we reported net loss attributable to common shareholders of $210.5 million, $348.8 million and $51.8 million, or $4.12, $6.88 and $1.24 per diluted share, respectively.
Oil and Gas Production Revenues
Revenues presented in the table and the discussion below represent revenues from sales of oil and natural gas production volumes.
During the second quarter of 2008, we completed the sale of 0.96 MMBoe of proved Gulf of Mexico (“GOM”) reserves in the form of a 15% limited-term overriding royalty interest for $82.0 million. In accordance with the accounting standards for extractive activities - oil and gas, the transaction was accounted for as a volumetric production payment. The net proceeds received were recorded as deferred revenue to be recognized in earnings as the production was delivered. The table below includes oil and gas production revenues from amortization of deferred revenue related to this transaction. Because the volumetric production payment represents a conveyance, the reserves were treated as sold in 2008 and the table below does not reflect any production volumes associated with those revenues.
Index to Financial Statements Revenues from production increased in 2011 compared to 2010 due to a 40% increase in average realized sales price and a 37% increase in oil production partially offset by a 10% decrease in natural gas production. The oil production increase occurred in the Gulf of Mexico where, by the end of 2011, we had production from three wells at our Telemark Hub. The higher average realized sales price is due to increased commodity market prices.
Revenues from production increased in 2010 compared to 2009 due to a 30% increase in production and a 24% increase in average realized sales price. The production increase occurred primarily in the Gulf of Mexico where, by the end of 2010, we had production from two wells at our Telemark Hub, where we had a workover operation and reversion of an overriding revenue interest at our Gomez Hub and where our Canyon Express property had been returned to production. The higher average realized sales price was due to increased commodity market prices.
Index to Financial Statements Other Revenues
Other revenues for 2009 are comprised of amounts realized under our loss of production income insurance policy due to disruptions caused by Hurricane Ike.
Lease Operating
Lease operating expenses include costs incurred to operate and maintain wells. These costs include, among others, workover expenses, operator fees, processing fees and insurance. Lease operating expense was as follows (in thousands, except per Boe amounts):
Lease operating expense for 2011 decreased overall by $10.3 million compared to 2010. The increase in recurring lease operating expense was primarily due to the new production from the Telemark Hub. The workover expenses during 2011 were primarily due to hydrate remediation activities, hull repair work and well work at our Telemark Hub and Gomez Hub properties. The workover expenses for 2010 were primarily due to hydrate remediation activities on our Canyon Express pipeline which enabled us to commence production at our Kings Peak well and to re-establish production from two wells at Aconcagua. Per unit costs changed primarily due to the effect of changing production volumes on fixed costs.
Lease operating expense for 2010 increased overall by $47.6 million compared to 2009. The increase in recurring operating expense was primarily due to the new production from the Telemark and Canyon Express Hubs. The workover expenses during 2010 were primarily due to inspection activities on many of our Gulf of Mexico properties and hydrate remediation activities on our Canyon Express and Telemark Hubs, which enabled us to commence production at our new well at Kings Peak and to re-establish production from two wells at Aconcagua. The workover expenses for 2009 included Hurricane Ike repairs and non-routine surveys for properties in the North Sea.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses are overhead-related expenses, including employee compensation, legal and accounting fees, insurance, and investor relations expenses. General and administrative expense was as follows:
Index to Financial Statements Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization
Depreciation, depletion and amortization (“DD&A”) expense was as follows:
DD&A expense for 2011 increased $77.9 million compared to 2010 primarily due to the increase in production at our Telemark Hub. The per unit increase in the Gulf of Mexico is primarily a result of higher costs incurred on our new developments relative to some of our older properties and the recognition of straight-line depreciation on our ATP Titan production platform which was placed into service at the beginning of the second quarter of 2010. The per unit costs for the North Sea decreased primarily due to the effect of production mix differences.
DD&A expense for 2010 increased $67.9 million compared to 2009 primarily due to the commencement of production at Telemark Hub. The per unit increase in the Gulf of Mexico is primarily a result of higher costs incurred on our new developments relative to some of our older properties and the recognition of straight-line depreciation on our ATP Titan production platform. The per unit costs for the North Sea decreased primarily due to the effect of production mix differences.
Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties
We recorded impairments during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 totaling $53.0 million, $42.4 million and $44.6 million, respectively, on certain proved properties in the Gulf of Mexico. We also recorded impairments totaling $1.2 million and $14.9 million during 2011 and 2010, on certain proved properties in the North Sea. The 2011 and 2010 impairments were primarily due to updated performance history. The 2009 impairments were primarily a result of reduced commodity prices and unfavorable operating performance.
Impairments of unproved properties were $3.4 million, $6.0 million and $1.2 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, primarily related to surrendered leases in the Gulf of Mexico.
Accretion of Asset Retirement Obligation
Accretion expense in 2011 was $15.0 million compared to $13.8 million in 2010 and $11.7 million in 2009.
Drilling Interruption Costs
Drilling interruption costs represent the costs we have incurred as a result of the deepwater drilling moratoriums and subsequent drilling permit delays caused by the April 2010 Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf of Mexico. During 2011, we incurred $19.7 million stand-by costs related to drilling operations at our Telemark and Gomez Hubs. During 2010, a side-track well operation in 7,000 feet of water was interrupted when the moratorium was imposed and work on that project stopped, resulting in the early termination of a drilling contract. In the course of obtaining a full release from our obligations under the contract, we incurred net costs of $8.7 million. Additionally, 2010 drilling interruption costs include $14.9 million of stand-by costs related to drilling operations at our Telemark and Gomez Hubs.
Loss on Abandonment
We recognized aggregate loss on abandonment during 2011, 2010 and 2009 of $3.9 million, $4.8 million and $2.9 million, respectively. These amounts are the result of actual abandonment costs exceeding the previously accrued estimates, due to unforeseen circumstances that required additional work, or the use of equipment more expensive than anticipated and unanticipated vendor price increases.
Index to Financial Statements Gain on Exchange/Disposal of Properties
In December 2011, we sold to a third party our 100% working interest in the deep operating rights of one of our Gulf of Mexico properties resulting in substantially all of the $27.0 million gain on disposal of properties we recognized in 2011.
In 2010, we sold to a third party our 67% working interest in the deep operating rights of one of our Gulf of Mexico properties resulting in a $15.0 million gain. In 2010, we also consummated a nonmonetary exchange of our 10% nonoperated working interest in MC Block 800, for an incremental 50% working interest in MC Block 754, both proved undeveloped properties. The consolidated financial statements reflect the incremental interest acquired in MC Block 754 at fair value and removal of the carrying costs of MC Block 800, resulting in recognition of a $12.0 million gain.
In December 2009, we sold to a third party our 25% working interest in the deep operating rights of one of our Gulf of Mexico properties for $13.0 million in cash, all of which was recognized as a gain.
Interest Income
Interest income varies directly with the amount of temporary cash investments. The decrease in interest income from period to period is the result of a decrease in average cash on hand and a decrease in interest rates.
Interest Expense, Net
Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized is set forth in the following table (in thousands):
The increase in interest expense in 2011 compared to 2010 is primarily due to: (i) an approximate $462 million increase in our aggregate average balance outstanding of debt and other long term obligations in 2011 at a weighted average interest rate of 14.2% in 2011 compared to 13.5% in 2010 (see Note 6, “Long-term Debt” and Note 7, “Other Long-term Obligations” to the Consolidated Financial Statements); (ii) higher noncash interest resulting from the amortization of additional debt-related discounts and issuance costs; and (iii) an increase in interest expense on one of our dollar denominated overrides due to a reduction in the estimated remaining repayment period of the override as a result of greater than forecasted production from the underlying properties at higher than forecasted prices. A reduction in the expected time required to pay the obligation results in an increase in the investor’s internal rate of return and requires a corresponding change in the estimated amortization and associated interest expense we record on the obligation. In 2010, our Telemark Hub was placed in service and we therefore ceased capitalizing related interest expense.
The increase in interest expense in 2010 compared to 2009 is primarily due to: (i) an approximate $619 million increase in the aggregate average balance outstanding of debt and other long term obligations in 2010 at a weighted average interest rate of 13.5% in 2010 compared to 10.6% in 2009; and (ii) higher noncash interest resulting from the amortization of additional debt-related discounts and issuance costs.
Index to Financial Statements Derivative Income (Expense)
Derivative income (expense) is primarily related to net gains and losses associated with our oil and gas price derivative contracts and is as follows (in thousands):
Gain (Loss) on Debt Extinguishment
Gain on debt extinguishment of $1.1 million for 2011 was related to an NPI transaction in the Telemark Hub for $40.0 million. The third party purchaser acquired an existing vendor NPI for $19.7 million, thereby extinguishing the existing NPI liability of $20.8 million, and contributed an additional $20.3 million toward the development of the Telemark Hub in exchange for a larger percentage of the net profits from production at the Telemark Hub that will continue until the purchaser recovers $40.0 million, plus an overall rate of return.
Loss on debt extinguishment was $75.3 million in 2010 primarily due to the second quarter refinancing of our previously outstanding term loans in which we charged to expense the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs, debt discount related to the retired debt and repayment premiums.
Income Taxes
During 2011, we recorded a net tax expense of $18.1 million, determined based on the results of operations for the year for each jurisdiction and permanent differences affecting the overall tax rate in each jurisdiction, resulting in an effective tax rate of (12.27%). Included in 2011 foreign operations is the effect of an increase in the UK statutory tax rate from 20% to 30% resulting in a decrease of 8.28% to the effective tax rate benefit on the current year pretax book loss. As of December 31, 2011, for U.S. tax provision purposes, we have a valuation allowance of $155.4 million, which is comprised of a $152.4 million valuation allowance against the net deferred income tax asset position and a $3.0 million valuation allowance related to excess tax benefits from stock options and restricted stock prior to adoption of accounting standards related to stock-based compensation. In addition, as of December 31, 2011 for Netherlands’ income tax provision purposes, we have a valuation allowance of $4.9 million, and for Israel income tax provision purposes, we have a valuation allowance of $0.5 million related to the net operating loss carryovers generated in 2011 and in prior periods.
During 2010, we recorded a net tax benefit of $36.3 million, determined based on the results of operations for the year for each jurisdiction and permanent differences affecting the overall tax rate in each jurisdiction, resulting in an effective tax rate of 10.1%. As of December 31, 2011, for U.S. tax provision purposes, we have a valuation allowance of $97.4 million, which is comprised of a $94.4 million valuation allowance against the net deferred income tax asset position and a $3.0 million valuation allowance related to excess tax benefits from stock options and restricted stock prior to adoption of accounting standards related to stock-based compensation. In addition, as of December 31, 2011 for Netherlands’ income tax provision purposes, we have a valuation allowance of $1.7 million related to the net operating loss carryovers generated in 2010 and in prior periods.
During 2009, we recorded a net tax benefit of $22.5 million, determined based on the results of operations for the year for each jurisdiction and permanent differences affecting the overall tax rate in each jurisdiction, resulting in an effective tax rate of 38.8%. As of December 31, 2009, for U.S. tax provision purposes, we have
