"ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
General
NetBank, Inc. is a financial holding company engaged primarily in retail banking, mortgage banking, business finance and providing ATM and merchant processing services. NetBank, Inc. wholly owns the outstanding stock of: NetBank (“NetBank, FSB” or the “Bank”), a federal savings bank; MG Reinsurance Company (“MG Reinsurance”), a captive reinsurance company; NetInsurance, Inc. (“NetInsurance”), a licensed insurance agency; and NB Partners, Inc., a corporation involved in strategic partnering opportunities. NetBank, FSB owns all of the outstanding stock of: Market Street Mortgage Corporation (“Market Street”), a retail mortgage company; NetBank Payment Systems, Inc. (“NPS”), a provider of ATM and merchant processing services for retail and other non-bank businesses; Meritage Mortgage Corporation (“Meritage”), a wholesale non-conforming mortgage provider; and Financial Technologies, Inc. (“FTI”), a provider of transaction processing services to other financial services companies. NetBank, FSB’s wholesale mortgage division operates as NetBank Funding Services (“NetBank Funding”); its business financing division operates as “NetBank Business Finance”; its automobile financing division operates as “Dealer Financial Services”; and its recreational vehicle financing division operates as “Beacon Credit Services”. The consolidated company is referred to herein as “we,” “us,” “our,” “NetBank,” or “the Company”.
During the fourth quarter of 2005, FTI, formerly a subsidiary of NB Partners, Inc., became a subsidiary of NetBank, FSB. During the fourth quarter of 2004, RBMG, Inc., formerly a subsidiary of NetBank, FSB, was legally consolidated into NetBank, FSB and now operates as the NetBank Funding Services division of NetBank, FSB. During the third quarter of 2004, Resource Bancshares Mortgage Group, Inc. (“Resource”) and Republic Leasing Company, Inc. (“Republic”), both of which had been subsidiaries of NetBank, FSB, were legally consolidated into NetBank, FSB. Republic now operates as the NetBank Business Finance division of NetBank, FSB. During the third quarter of 2004, Meritage became a wholly-owned subsidiary of NetBank, FSB instead of a direct subsidiary of the Company.
NetBank was founded in October 1996 and completed its initial public offering of stock in July 1997. It is one of the pioneers of the Internet banking industry, and NetBank, FSB is recognized as one of the first successful internet-only banks. Further information regarding the growth of the Company through acquisitions is contained in note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report and is incorporated herein by reference.
Unless otherwise noted, all dollar figures are presented in thousands (000s), except per share data, and net income per share is presented on a diluted basis. All of the Company’s operations and assets are located within the United States of America.
Executive Summary
Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $180 or $0.00 per share, compared to net income of $4,220 or $.09 per share, for 2004, which included a $29,000 provision for loss on its investment in leases originated by Commercial Money Center, Inc. (“CMC”). See Item 3. “Legal Proceedings”, “Future Outlook-Material Pending Litigation” below and notes 5 and 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional details regarding our loan and lease receivables, including our investment in the CMC lease portfolio, the associated litigation and the associated allowance for credit losses.
Our results continue to be adversely impacted by the flattening of the yield curve which reduced net interest earned on interest earning assets. In addition, earnings were also negatively impacted by competitive market pressures within the financial intermediary segment, particularly within our nonconforming mortgage operations. Our 2005 results were also negatively impacted due to higher than anticipated required repurchases related to our representations and warranties on mortgages sold. Finally, we recorded an additional $3,500 provision during the third quarter of 2005 related to a select group of loans previously sold. See note 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report for further discussion.
Despite the factors above, management continued to make significant progress towards reaching its revenue diversification strategy. Management previously set a long-term goal of achieving an equal balance of earnings between its retail banking, financial intermediary and transaction processing segments. Although the volatility in the financial intermediary segment manifested itself during 2005 with the segment reporting a pre-tax loss of $15,533, resulting in net loss on a consolidated basis, we made progress in growing the pre-tax earnings of our other business segments.
During 2005 and 2004, the retail banking segment implemented a number of strategies to improve earnings including retaining a large portion of internally originated loans and leases that carry lower risks than loans previously held for investment. The retail banking segment retained $200,278 of HELOCs, $412,522 of auto loans and $194,456 of business finance leases in 2005. The retail banking segment’s pre-tax results improved by $30,176 to $19,100 for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared with the same period in 2004. Included in the 2004 results is a $29,000 provision for loss on our investment in leases originated by CMC. Exclusive of this charge, the retail banking segment’s pre-tax results for 2005 would have improved by $1,176 over 2004.
The transaction processing segment reported an improvement in pre-tax earnings of $792. This resulted from significant improvements at our NetInsurance and NPS subsidiaries as well as improved expense control in servicing operations.
Future Outlook
Our objective is to become a premier provider of financial products and services to our targeted market segments. Our strategy is multi-faceted, involving:
Retail Banking. NetBank, FSB operates as an FDIC-insured, federally chartered thrift institution that currently serves over 285 thousand customers throughout the United States and in more than 80 foreign countries. NetBank, FSB operates a totally branchless model and passes on a portion of the cost savings to its customers in the form of attractive yields on deposits. NetBank, FSB’s array of products and services are available to its customers 24 hours per day, seven days a week, 365 days a year.
Financial Intermediary. Through our mortgage banking operations, we serve as an intermediary between consumers and institutional investors. We obtain mortgage loans by originating loans directly with consumers, through brokers or by buying closed loans from a network of correspondent banks, thrifts and independent mortgage companies. The majority of these loans are held for sale on the Company’s balance sheet prior to delivery into the secondary market. We thus earn a long-term yield, on an asset held short-term, and also earn origination and servicing revenues and gains on the sale of the mortgages or resulting mortgage-backed securities (sometimes referred to herein as “MBS”).
Transaction Processing. The following summarizes our transaction processing initiatives:
· We run a servicing factory that services over 120,000 loans for internal and external customers.
· Late in 2003, we expanded our transaction processing capabilities by acquiring NPS. NPS is one of the top five providers of ATM services for retail and non-bank businesses, and we have the 2nd largest bank-operated ATM network in the country. At December 31, 2005, through organic growth and acquisition, NPS operated 9,649 ATM machines and 2,367 merchant processing terminals. The ATM network, in addition to supplying fee revenue, provides a convenient way for NetBank FSB’s customers to access cash throughout the United States.
· “Check 21” legislation was passed by Congress in the fall of 2003, and it became effective on October 28, 2004. Banks may now clear checks through substitutes such as digital images. The checks may be truncated, customers may be provided images of checks, and banks may exchange data instead of physical checks. We have built a new processing engine that can do Automatic Clearing House (“ACH”) and Check 21 clearing. We offer these payment processing services to community banks and to our small business customers.
· During 2005, in partnership with The United Postal Service (“UPS”) Store, we developed a deposit and payment forwarding service called “QuickPost”. Using QuickPost, customers take their checks and completed deposit slip or payment coupon to the nearest location of The UPS Store. Once there, customers place their items in a QuickPost envelope and submit the envelope for delivery to NetBank at no cost to them. All QuickPost envelopes are then sent via UPS Next Day Air delivery from The UPS Store to our state-of-the-art payment processing center. This new service has enhanced NetBank FSB’s ability to efficiently serve its customers in a branchless, Internet-only environment. We now offer QuickPost to other financial institutions that have a limited retail presence nationwide.
In 2003, we announced a strategy to diversify our earnings so that one third is provided by each of our principal operating segments: retail banking, financial intermediary and transaction processing. Over the long-term, our goal is to achieve a better, more stable, balance across our different segments. But, over the short-term, we have had to adjust, and may continue to have to adjust, that targeted balance as market conditions dictate, and one segment may outperform the others. The objective of diversifying our efforts across different but complementary lines of business is to have options and opportunities to manage our complementary businesses through different economic environments. The following summarizes pre-tax
(loss) income by segment for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005. The retail banking segment results for 2004 include the $29.0 million provision for credit losses on our CMC lease portfolio as discussed below.
We are pleased with the progress made in 2004 and 2005 in expanding earnings from our retail banking and transaction processing segments. However, as discussed below, unpredictability in the earnings of the financial intermediary segment continues to make our consolidated earnings volatile.
We believe that our deposit base will continue to grow as Internet usage and Internet-based commerce grow. We believe that we can continue to invest those deposits profitably in mortgage loans held temporarily for sale and loans held for investment. We also believe that non-interest earnings in the form of fees and gains on sale resulting from our financial intermediary and transaction processing activities can potentially provide a better diversity of earnings than the traditional banking model.
While we are optimistic about our short- and long-term prospects, the following should be considered in evaluating our earnings and growth outlook.
Volatility of Mortgage Banking Income. All of our earnings in 2003 came from the financial intermediary segment when mortgage interest rates were at historically low levels. This prompted refinance and home purchase mortgage volumes to grow to the highest levels in history. Total mortgage industry production volumes were just under $3.8 trillion for 2003. Interest rates began climbing during the third quarter of 2003, and mortgage banking industry production volumes dropped to $2.772 trillion during 2004. Estimated mortgage banking industry production for 2005 is $2.787 trillion, flat when compared to 2004 production. As production volumes dropped in 2004 and 2005 relative to the record production levels in 2003, competitive pressures mounted, resulting in a drop in gain on sale margins in 2004 and 2005 compared to 2003. The decrease in 2005 compared with 2004 related primarily to lower margins in the non-conforming mortgage business as new market participants, especially portfolio lenders focused on leveraging up their balance sheets as quickly as possible, engaged in aggressive pricing to capture market share.
The Mortgage Bankers Association of America’s forecast calls for total mortgage production of $2.244 trillion for 2006, representing a 19% drop in volume from 2005. Although we believe that our offerings of adjustable rate and other alternative mortgage products and the continued growth of our retail channel (which is less dependent on refinance volume) will soften some of the impact of declines in available volume, there can be no assurance that we will be able to sustain current production volume levels. Likewise, there is no assurance that the current competitive pressures, especially in the non-conforming channel, will subside. The following summarizes some of our significant threats and opportunities under a reduced volume scenario:
· Total production volume could decline, resulting in less net interest margin on loans held for sale, less gain on sale, and less production-related fee revenue.
· Gain on sale margins could remain at present levels or drift even lower due to increased competition for available mortgage application volume.
· Production costs per unit could rise as the result of a reduction in leverage gained on fixed costs (fixed costs are spread over a smaller number of units).
This impact may be offset, in part, by the following additional potential effects of the rising rate environment:
· The value of mortgage servicing rights could increase as actual and forecasted prepayments go down. Although these assets are carried at the lower of cost or market, accounting rules allow for the reversal of previously established reserves as a result of impairment. Recent accounting pronouncements will allow us to elect fair value accounting for our servicing rights commencing January 1, 2006. However, as servicing values rise, our servicing hedge values would go down, offsetting a portion of the reserve recovery (or increase in fair value).
· With reduced prepayments, mortgage servicing revenues would improve.
· The Company could elect to take a portion of existing excess liquidity and liquidity freed up by the reduced loan production volume and invest in additional interest-earning assets at the then higher interest rates.
Material Pending Litigation. As discussed in note 19 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report, we are involved in litigation with three insurance companies who are sureties on some of NetBank, FSB’s commercial lease portfolios. NetBank, FSB has filed a claim for payments that are currently past due. During 2004, in response to settlements between the sureties and other holders of CMC leases, we recorded an additional $29.0 million in allowance for credit losses and wrote our carrying value on the CMC leases down by $50.2 million resulting in a remaining balance of $31.5 million. Through additional cash receipts, the remaining book balance of CMC receivables was down to $26 million at December 31, 2005. The entire portfolio is on non-accrual status. In August 2005, the U.S. District Court issued a favorable ruling for banks with respect to the multi-district litigation (“MDL”) proceedings. The court issued two opinions in which it ruled against one of the sureties, Illinois Union. It is expected that Illinois Union will appeal. With respect to the other two sureties, Safeco and Royal, the court did not grant the banks’ motion but instead stated that the banks must first prove that they were the intended “obligee” in the leases, and that there was no fraud on the part of the banks. We believe our case is strong, and that we will be able to successfully assert that we were the intended “obligee” and that there was no fraud on our part. During the fourth quarter of 2005, the court ordered mediation through March 15, 2006.
However, there is no assurance that the suit or resulting appeals will ultimately be decided in our favor nor is there any assurance as to the length of time it may take for us to prevail. The following summarizes the material impact some of the possible outcomes could have on the results of our results of operations and financial condition for 2006 and beyond:
· Further victories in the action or a favorable settlement could result in our being able to recover all or a portion of the CMC lease receivables charged off in 2004;
· A loss in the case against Safeco or Royal or in an appeal of the Illinois Union ruling could cause us to record additional provisions for loss on these assets and the continuation of non-accrual status; and
· Prolonged litigation could result in the continuation of non-accrual status, continued payment of large legal fees, and the potential for recording additional provisions for losses on these assets in the future.
Acquisitions. As described in Note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report, during 2005 we expanded our ATM and merchant processing business by acquiring smaller processors or service contracts and expanded our retail mortgage origination operations by acquiring additional retail branches. We do not expect to acquire a business that would be considered material (i.e., 20% of pre-tax income, total assets or total shareholders’ equity) in the near future; however, we will
continue to pursue strategic acquisitions such as these which fit into our long-term strategy of diversifying our earnings by expanding less cyclical revenue generating operations.
Flat Treasury Yield Curve. Normally, short-term interest rates are lower than long-term interest rates. However, continual increases by the Federal Reserve throughout 2004 and 2005 in targeted short-term rates has caused the yield on short-term Treasury instruments to be only slightly below or at times equal to the yields of medium-term and long-term Treasury securities. This flattening of the yield curve adversely impacts our earnings as follows:
· We earn less of a spread on loans held for sale that are financed with short-term liabilities.
· The risk adjusted net interest spread of incremental earning assets coming onto the balance sheet as held for investment or available for sale assets is lower than in a normal yield curve environment.
· To the extent that any existing earning assets were funded by shorter duration liabilities, our net interest margin compresses as those liabilities re-price.
Capital Constraints on Retail Bank Growth. One of the tactics in achieving the strategy of diversifying our revenue sources is to grow the earning assets of the Bank. We desire to maintain the Bank’s status as “Well Capitalized” under OTS guidelines. Accordingly, the absence of earnings during 2005 is beginning to put constraints on further growth of the Bank. Several times over the past few years NetBank, Inc. has issued trust-preferred securities and used the proceeds to infuse additional capital into the Bank. Further offerings of trust-preferred securities may not be successful in generating additional capital for the Bank.
Such capital constraints coupled with the impact discussed above of the flattening yield curve could cause the suspension of growth in earning assets. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for more information regarding risks associated with failure to satisfy capital requirements.
Impact of SFAS 123r. We will adopt SFAS 123r, Share-Based Payment, effective January 1, 2006. We intend to adopt SFAS 123r using the Modified-Prospective Transition provisions of SFAS 123r, which will require financial statement recognition of the fair value of all share-based payments that vest subsequent to adoption. Based on the historical level of share-based awards, we have estimated that the adoption of SFAS 123r will result in approximately $3.5 million of additional compensation expense to be recorded in 2006. For a discussion of other recent accounting pronouncements, see note 3 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
Financial Condition
General. The Company’s assets totaled $4,771,619 at December 31, 2005, an increase of $149,438 or 3% from December 31, 2004. This increase is primarily due to the following factors. First, loans and leases receivables increased $128,531 as a result of management’s decision to retain a greater portion of the Company’s internally originated loan and leases from our auto lending, mortgage operations and NetBank Business Finance divisions. Secondly, loans held for sale also increased $60,139. This increase can be attributed to decreased sales in 2005 versus 2004 as production remained relatively flat. In addition, mortgage servicing rights increased by $29,061 due to retention of servicing rights on internally produced loans, an acquisition of bulk servicing rights having a capitalized value of $35,181 and a $14,055 recovery of servicing rights. These increases were partially offset by a $74,218 decrease in our investment securities available for sale to $626,077 at December 31, 2005.
Liabilities increased by $163,065 primarily related to an increase in deposits as we continue to experience growth within the retail banking segment. Other borrowed funds also increased $36,749 in order to support our growth in loan and lease receivables and loans held for sale portfolios.
Investment Securities. Our investment policy is designed to provide and maintain liquidity and to generate favorable returns without incurring undue interest rate risk, credit risk and investment portfolio concentrations. In accordance with the policy, during 2005, we sold certain investment securities for a net gain of $4,675. We may continue to acquire and dispose of securities within the parameters of our investment strategy which may result in additional gains or losses.
Securities classified as available for sale are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in other comprehensive income. All investment securities are currently classified as available for sale. The following tables set forth certain information relating to our available for sale securities:
Although certain securities have an unrealized loss that has persisted for more than 12 continuous months, management does not believe that any of the securities within the portfolio are impaired. We believe that the decrease in the value of the portfolio is related to increasing interest rates versus declining credit worthiness. We performed an assessment and applied the principles of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Staff Position (“FSP”) 115-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, and concluded that an other-than-temporary impairment should not be recognized.
Reference is made to note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional details regarding the maturity, duration of unrealized losses and weighted average interest rate of our investment securities available for sale portfolio.
Loans Held for Sale. For the year ended December 31, 2005, loans held for sale, which consist primarily of mortgage loans, increased by $60,139 to $1,233,918 compared to $1,173,779 as of December 31, 2004. This increase is the result of decreased sales volumes during 2005. Industry-wide production of mortgages and sales of mortgages decreased during 2005 primarily as a result of an increase in long-term mortgage interest rates and generally softer demand.
Loan and Lease Receivables. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the loan and lease receivables portfolio increased $128,531 or 6% to $2,224,363 at December 31, 2005. Loan and lease receivables increased as a result of our strategy to selectively retain a larger portion of originated loans and leases. During 2005, we retained $200,278 of internally originated mortgage loans (primarily HELOCs), $412,522 of internally originated auto loans and $194,456 of originated business finance loans and leases. The retention of these internally originated assets was offset, in part, by principal payments and reductions of $257,245 and $55,805 in first and seconds mortgages, respectively.
The following is a summary of NetBank’s loan and lease receivables as of December 31:
The following table sets forth certain information regarding the contractual maturity of our loan and lease receivables portfolio as of December 31, 2005. Loans or leases having no stated schedule of repayments and no stated maturity are reported as due in one year or less. The table includes prepayment assumptions based on current market conditions and thus does not necessarily reflect actual contractual maturity or repayment dates.
The following table segregates our loan and lease receivables by fixed and floating interest rates as of December 31, 2005:
The following is a summary of the allocation of the allowance for credit losses for the years ended December 31:
The following table details our non-accrual and troubled debt restructurings:
(1) As more fully described in note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report, all loans and leases over 90 days contractually past due are placed on non-accrual status.
(2) Includes only those troubled debt restructurings which were less than 90 days past due as of the periods reported. Troubled debt restructurings over 90 days past due have been included in the non-accrual categories.
The following is a summary of the allowance for credit losses for the years ended December 31:
The tables above include a provision of $20,102 in 2002 related to the CMC lease portfolio which was placed on non-accrual status during the second quarter of 2002. We made a provision for an additional $29,000 and wrote off $50,230 of our investment in the CMC lease portfolio during the fourth quarter of 2004. The remaining investment will continue on non-accrual status and is periodically evaluated for recoverability. See Item 3. “Legal Proceedings,” and notes 5, 6 and 19 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional details regarding our loan and lease receivables, including its investment in the CMC lease portfolio, the associated litigation and the associated allowance for credit losses.
The non-CMC leases are originated by our NetBank Business Finance division. These leases consist primarily of equipment leases to small businesses. The Company provides an allowance for credit losses on such leases based upon life of lease loss estimates resulting from static loss analysis by vintage year of production. The increase in the non-CMC related reserves relates to the retention of leases by the Company over time.
During 2005 and 2004, our portfolios of HELOCs grew as a result of the retention of targeted products from our mortgage banking operations. We provide an allowance for credit losses on all mortgage products based on a life of loan estimate of losses. Such life of loan loss estimates are based upon rating agency estimates of losses for mortgage-backed securities containing loans with similar credit quality. The Company’s allocated allowance for credit losses grew from $1,334 to $4,244 for HELOCs from
December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2005 as the result of an increase in the underlying portfolios from $115,068 to $257,991 during the period. The Company’s allocated allowance for credit losses for second mortgages decreased from $4,451 to $2,973 from December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2005. This decrease reflected a decrease of principal balance relating to payoffs of second mortgages and retention of selected second mortgages to borrowers with higher credit scores, resulting in reduced loss estimates as a percentage of outstanding principal.
In the spring of 2003, we opened the Dealer Financial Services division for the purpose of originating indirect auto loans through a third party network of regional auto dealers. For such auto loans, the Company provides, at a minimum, allowances based upon loss estimates for the next twelve months plus any additional amounts necessary for classified assets. Our loss estimates are based primarily on the credit scores of the underlying borrowers. The Company monitors its actual loss experience versus its expected loss experience and makes appropriate adjustments to its provision and allowance. The increase in the Company’s allocated allowance from a December 31, 2004 balance of $1,593 to $2,948 as of December 31, 2005 resulted primarily from an increase in the underlying portfolio of $218,990.
Asset Quality and Non-performing Assets. We periodically review the performance of our loan and lease receivables by reviewing charge-offs, delinquency statistics and various other industry statistics. Large non-homogeneous credits are reviewed on a loan-by-loan or lease-by-lease basis, whereas relatively small credits with similar risk characteristics are reviewed on a pool-by-pool basis. If a decline in credit quality for a specific pool or individual loan or lease is noted, we record additional allowance through a charge to the provision for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level estimated to be adequate to provide for probable losses in the loan and lease receivables portfolio. We determine the adequacy of the allowance based upon reviews of individual loans and leases, recent loss experience, current economic conditions, the risk characteristics of the various categories of loans and leases and other pertinent factors. Our non-performing loan and lease receivables as a percentage of gross unpaid principal balance (“UPB”) improved from 1.7% at December 31, 2004, to 1.5% at December 31, 2005. Reference is made to note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information regarding the specific types and amounts of our non-performing assets.
The following tables set forth information regarding our loan and lease receivables, including the allocated allowance and non-accrual assets:
(1) Non-performing includes all loans, including restructured loans, that are 90 days or more contractually past due. The Company also held $6,782 and $4,588 of performing restructured loans as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
(2) Reference is made to note 6 and 19 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional details regarding the CMC lease portfolio.
As more fully described in note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report, our loans held for sale are carried at the aggregate of the lower of cost or market until being sold, typically 30 to 90 days after origination or purchase. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the aggregate market value of loans held for sale exceeded the aggregate cost. The majority of our non-performing loans held for sale consist of loans which the Company has been required to repurchase under representations and warranties provided to purchasers of our loans. Once a loan has been repurchased, it is generally resold at a loss. Upon repurchase, the Company transfers reserves from its liability for representations and warranties to a valuation reserve for repurchased loans to record such loans at estimated net realizable value. The following tables set forth information regarding our loans held for sale:
Mortgage Servicing Rights. We intend to retain substantially all of our originated conventional mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) in order to achieve the necessary critical mass the transaction processing segment requires to sustain operational profitably. During 2005, execution of conforming conventional loans into the secondary market in whole loan, servicing released sales was frequently more profitable than creating mortgage-backed securities and retaining the servicing rights. However, the 17% growth in the MSRs during 2005 was attributed primarily to the purchase of a $2.5 billion portfolio, having
a capitalizable value of $35,181. In addition, we recorded a recovery of MSR value of $14,055. These increases in MSRs were partially off-set by amortization of $45,389.
Derivatives. The value of derivatives hedging the MSR portfolio were $23,558 at December 31, 2005 compared to $10,081 at December 31, 2004, an increase of $13,477. The derivatives consist primarily of commitments to purchase mortgage pool securities, options, floors, swaps, swaption",0
"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION
EARNINGS OVERVIEW
The Company reported earnings of $3.7 million in 2000, or $1.73 diluted earnings per share. This represents an increase of 10.3% from 1999 when earnings were $3.3 million. This increase was primarily the result of a $1.5 million increase in net interest income reduced by a $914,000 increase in the provision for loans losses plus a slight increase in noninterest expenses.
The Company reported net earnings of $3.3 million or $1.49 diluted earnings per share for 1999. This represents almost a threefold increase from 1998 when net earnings were $1.2 million or $0.55 diluted earnings per share. This significant increase occurred as the Company experienced strong growth in operating income (up approximately 8%) and significantly lowers operating costs (down approximately 12%). Nonrecurring 1998 costs associated with the CIB merger and a reduction of approximately 10% in personnel costs represented the majority of this decline.
The following table sets forth several key operating ratios for 2000, 1999 and 1998:
DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
The following table presents, for the years indicated, the distribution of average assets, liabilities and shareholders' equity, as well as the total dollar amounts of interest income from average interest-earning assets and the resultant yields, and the dollar amounts of interest expense and average interest-bearing liabilities, expressed both in dollars and in rates. Nonaccrual loans are included in the calculation of the average balances of loans, and interest not accrued is excluded (dollar amounts in thousands).
EARNINGS ANALYSIS
NET INTEREST INCOME
Net interest income is the amount by which the interest and amortization of fees generated from loans and other earning assets exceeds the cost of funding those assets, usually deposit account interest expense. Net interest income depends on the difference (the ""interest rate spread"") between gross interest and fees earned on the loans and investment portfolios and the interest rates paid on deposits and borrowings.
Net interest income for 2000 was $15.7 million, an increase of $1.5 million or 10.7% when compared to $14.2 million in 1999. This increase was attributable to the growth in interest-earning assets and an increase in the net yield on interest-earning assets from 6.58% in 1999 compared to 6.94% in 2000. Interest-earning assets increased $10.7 million or 4.9% to $226.8 million in 2000 compared to $216.2 million in 1999. Contributing to the overall increase in the net yield on interest-earning assets was the Company's growth in average loans, which increased $24.6 million. This growth was funded partially by the $7.3 million increase in interest-bearing liabilities and balance was funded by reducing the lower yielding investments and federal funds sold.
Net interest income for 1999 was $14.2 million, an increase of $1.1 million or 8.7% when compared to $13.1 million in 1998. This increase was primarily attributable to the growth in interest-earning assets, as the net yield on interest-earning assets was relatively unchanged at 6.58% in 1999 compared to 6.56% in 1998. Interest-earning assets increased $16.8 million or 8.4% to $216.2 million in 1999 compared to $199.4 million in 1998.
Interest income for 2000 was $21.6 million compared to $18.8 million in 1999. This increase of $2.8 million was comprised of additional income of $1.7 million resulting from increased interest-earning assets and $1.1 million resulting from an 81 basis point increase in the overall yield on interest- earning assets. As noted above, the increase in the net yield was positively impacted by the large increase in average loans.
Interest income for 1999 was $18.8 million compared to $18.1 million in 1998. This increase of $0.7 million was comprised of additional income of $2.2 million resulting from increased interest-earning assets reduced by $1.4 million resulting from a 34 basis point decline in the overall yield on interest-earning assets.
Interest expense in 2000 was $5.9 million compared to $4.6 million in 1999. This increase was due to a $7.3 million increase in total interest-bearing liabilities and a 67 basis point increase in the net rate paid on these liabilities. The increase in the rate paid on these liabilities was due to the increasing rate environment experienced in late 1999 and 2000.
Interest expense in 1999 was $4.6 million compared to $5.0 million in 1998. This decrease was primarily attributable to declining interest rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, which declined 30 basis points from 3.40% in 1998 to 3.10% in 1999. The positive impact on net interest income from this rate decline was partially offset by nominal increases in the average interest-bearing liabilities outstanding.
During 1999 the Company increased it average interest-earning assets by $16.8 million while limiting its increase in interest-bearing liabilities to $2.3 million. This apparent shortfall was funded primarily by a $11.4 million increase in average noninterest-bearing demand deposits and a $2.3 million increase in shareholders' equity. This form of funding has a positive impact of the Company's net interest income.
The following table sets forth changes in interest income and interest expense for each major category of interest-earning asset and interest-bearing liability, and the amount of change attributable to volume and rate changes for the years indicated. Changes not solely attributable to rate or volume
have been allocated to volume and rate changes in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the changes in each (dollar amounts in thousands).
PROVISION FOR LOANS LOSSES
The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that is considered adequate to provide for the loan losses inherent in the Company's loan portfolio. During 2000, the provision for loan losses was $1,634,000 compared to $720,000 in 1999 and $523,000 in 1998. See ""Allowance for Loan Losses"" later in this discussion for additional information on the Company's methodology for determining the adequacy of the allowance, summary of historical loan losses and analysis of overall asset quality.
NONINTEREST INCOME
Noninterest income was $2.8 million in 2000, of which approximately 90% were the traditional service charges on accounts and fees collected in commercial banking. This amount represents 1.1% of average assets for 2000. This was comparable to the $2.9 million, or 1.2% of average assets, reported in 1999 and the $2.7 million, or 1.2% of average assets, reported in 1998.
NONINTEREST EXPENSE
Noninterest expense reflects the costs of products and services related to systems, facilities and personnel for the Company. Noninterest expense was $12.2 million in 2000, $11.9 million in 1999 and $13.4 million in 1998. The major components of noninterest expense stated as a percentage of average assets are as follows:
Disregarding the restructuring charges and merger-related costs incurred in 1998, noninterest expense as a percentage of average assets has declined from 5.66% in 1998 to 4.77% in 2000. The Company believes this decline is primarily related to the operating efficiencies derived from its 1998 merger with Channel Islands Bank as well as its continuing effort to control and reduce noninterest expense.
INCOME TAXES
Income tax expense was $1,029,000, $1,145,000, and $678,000 for the years ended December 31, 2000, December 31, 1999, and December 31, 1998, respectively. These expenses resulted in an effective tax rate of 21.9% in 2000, 25.5% in 1999 and 36.8% in 1998. The significant decline in the effective rate in 2000 and 1999 was due to the utilization of previously unrecognized tax credits. During 2000 the Company utilized $706,000 of these credits, compared to $512,000 in 1999. No additional credits are available at December 31, 2000 and, therefore, the Company anticipates that its effective tax rate will rise in 2001. The Company's effective tax rate is also favorably impacted by its investments in municipal securities. See also Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Company's income taxes.
BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS
The Company's primarily operating goals for 2000 were the successful integration of the branches it obtained in the merger on December 31, 1998 with Channel Islands Bank, maximization of the operating efficiencies provided by that merger and growth in its core banking operations. The combination of these goals had the following impact on the Company's balance sheet.
First, the Company experienced asset growth of approximately 8.3%. Total assets at December 31, 2000 were $266.0 million compared to $246.0 million at December 31, 1999. This is compared to an increase of $4.3 million or 1.8% during 1999.
Similarly, the company experienced an increase in total deposits, which ended 2000 at $238.1 million compared to $209.9 million at the end of 1999. This increase of $28.2 million was used to fund the growth in assets noted above and to retire the $10.0 million in short-term borrowings outstanding at December 31, 1999.
INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO
The following table summarizes the amounts and distribution of the Company's investment securities held as of the dates indicated, and the weighted-average yields as of December 31, 2000 (dollar amounts in thousands):
Securities may be pledged to meet security requirements imposed as a condition to receipt of deposits of public funds and other purposes. At December 31, 2000 and 1999, the carrying values of securities pledged to secure public deposits and other purposes were approximately $9.8 million and $5.9 million, respectively. The increase in pledged investment securities is related to the lines of credit obtained from the Federal Home Loan Bank. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Company's investment portfolio.
LOAN PORTFOLIO
The following table sets forth the components of total net loans outstanding in each category at the date indicated (dollar amounts in thousands):
The following table shows the maturity distribution of the fixed rate portion of the loan portfolio and the repricing distribution of the variable rate portion of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2000:
ASSET QUALITY
The risk of nonpayment of loans is an inherent feature of the banking business. That risk varies with the type and purpose of the loan, the collateral that is utilized to secure payment, and ultimately, the credit worthiness of the borrower. In order to minimize this credit risk, the Loan Committee of the board of directors approves significant loans. The Loan Committee is comprised of directors and members of the Company's senior management.
The Company grades all loans from ""acceptable"" to ""loss"", depending on credit quality, with ""acceptable"" representing loans with an acceptable degree of risk given the favorable aspects of the credit and with both primary and secondary sources of repayment. Classified loans or substandard loans are ranked below ""acceptable"" loans. As these loans are identified in the review process, they are added to the internal watchlist and loss allowances are established for them. Additionally, the loan portfolio is examined regularly by the FDIC and DFI. Management also utilizes an independent loan review Company to assess loan portfolio quality and adequacy of the allowance for loan losses.
NONPERFORMING ASSETS
The following table provides information with respect to the components of the Company's nonperforming assets at the dates indicated (dollar amounts in thousands):
Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when they are delinquent 90 days or more, unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. The Company stops recognizing income from the interest on the loan and reverses any uncollected interest that had been accrued but not received. Loans are not returned to accrual status until it is brought current with respect to both principal and interest payments, the loan is performing to current terms and conditions, the interest rate is commensurate with market interest rates and future principal and interest payments are no longer in doubt. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Company's average investment in impaired loans and the amount of income recognized thereon.
In addition to the loans reported above, at December 31, 2000, the Company had loans totaling $6.7 million which it had graded less than acceptable. This amount increased 103% from the $3.3 million in similar loans at December 31, 1999. As discussed in the following section, evaluation of these loans is an integral portion of the Company's methodology for establishing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. The Company has no foreign loans in its loan portfolio.
ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES
The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that is considered adequate to provide for the loan losses inherent in Company's loans. The provision for loan losses was $1,634,000 in 2000 compared to $720,000 in 1999 and $523,000 in 1998.
The following table summarizes, for the years indicated, changes in the allowances for loan losses arising from loans charged-off, recoveries on loans previously charged-off, and additions to the allowance which have been charged to operating expenses and certain ratios relating to the allowance for loan losses (dollar amounts in thousands):
The Company performs quarterly detailed reviews to identify the risks inherent in the loan portfolio, assess the overall quality of the loan portfolio and to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses to be charged to expense. This systematic reviews follow the methodology set forth by the FDIC in its 1993 policy statement on the allowance for loan losses.
A key element of this methodology is the previously discussed credit classification process. Loans identified as less than ""acceptable"" are reviewed individually to estimate the amount of probable losses that need to be included in the allowance. These reviews include analysis of financial information as well as evaluation of collateral securing the credit. Additionally, the Company considers the inherent risk present in the ""acceptable"" portion of the loan portfolio taking into consideration historical losses on pools of similar loans, adjusted for trends, conditions and other relevant factors that may affect repayment of the loans in these pools. Upon completion, the written analysis is presented to the board of directors for discussion, review and approval.
The Company believes the allowance for loan losses to be adequate to provide for losses inherent in the loan portfolio. While the Company uses available information to recognize losses on loans and leases, future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions. In addition, federal regulators, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the allowance for loan losses and may recommend additions based upon their evaluation of the portfolio at the time of their examination. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the allowance for loan losses will be adequate to cover future loan losses or that significant additions to the allowance for loan losses will not be required in the future.
The following table summarizes the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan type for the years indicated and the percent of loans in each category to total loans (dollar amounts in thousands):
The Company's provision for loan losses increased in 2000 primarily for two reasons. First, although the Bank experienced a significant decline in nonperforming loans, as noted above, the Bank experienced a significant increase in its loans grade less than acceptable. Also, the Company has determined it has environmental risks in its real estate loan portfolio and added $500,000 to the unallocated portion of the allowance in consideration of these risks.
FUNDING
Deposits are the Company's primary source of funds. At December 31, 2000, the Company had a deposit mix of 40.5% in time and savings deposits, 27.6% in money market and NOW deposits, and 31.9% in noninterest-bearing demand deposits. The Company's net interest income is enhanced by its percentage of noninterest-bearing deposits.
The following table summarizes the distribution of average deposits and the average rates paid for the years indicated (dollar amounts in thousands):
The scheduled maturity distribution of the Company's time deposits, as of December 31, 2000, were as follows (dollar amounts in thousands):
OTHER BORROWINGS
To supplement its liquidity, the Company has a line of credit with its primary correspondent. Available credit on this line totaled $5 million. See Note 7 of the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
LIQUIDITY AND INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY
The objective of the Company's asset/liability strategy is to manage liquidity and interest rate risks to ensure the safety and soundness of the Bank and its capital base, while maintaining adequate net interest margins and spreads to provide an appropriate return to the Company's shareholders.
The Company manages its interest rate risk exposure by limiting the amount of long-term fixed rate loans it holds, increasing emphasis on shorter-term, higher yield loans for portfolio, increasing or decreasing the relative amounts of long-term and short-term borrowings and deposits and/or purchasing commitments to sell loans.
The table below sets forth the interest rate sensitivity of the Company's interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities as of December 31, 2000, using the interest rate sensitivity gap ratio. For purposes of the following table, an asset or liability is considered rate-sensitive within a specified period when it can be repriced or matures within its contractual terms, except for loans held for sale which the Company classifies as highly liquid based on historical sale patterns (dollar amounts in thousands):
Liquidity refers to the Company's ability to maintain a cash flow adequate to fund both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet requirements on a timely and cost-effective basis. Potentially significant liquidity requirements include funding of commitments to loan customers and withdrawals from deposit accounts.
CAPITAL RESOURCES
In 1990, the banking industry began to phase in new regulatory capital adequacy requirements based on risk-adjusted assets. These requirements take into consideration the risk inherent in investments, loans, and other assets for both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet items. Under these requirements, the regulatory agencies have set minimum thresholds for Tier 1 capital, total capital and leverage ratios. At December 31, 2000, the Bank's capital exceeded all minimum regulatory requirements and the Bank was considered to be ""well capitalized"" as defined in the regulations issued by the FDIC. The Bank's risk-based capital ratios, shown below as of December 31, 2000, have been
computed in accordance with regulatory accounting policies (The Company's capital ratios are comparable to the Bank's).
See also note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Bank's capital ratios.
On February 24, 2000, the Company approved a stock repurchase program for up to 200,000 of its outstanding shares. Repurchases will be made from time to time over the next three years in the open market and privately negotiated transactions based on their current market prices. During 2000 the Company repurchased 31,781 shares for $610,627 under this program.
EFFECTS OF INFLATION
The financial statements and related financial information presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or same magnitude as the price of goods and services.
IMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.
The information set forth and discussed in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is derived from the Financial Statements of iTech Medical, Inc. and the related notes thereto which are included as exhibits to this current report. The following information and discussion should be read in conjunction with such Financial Statements and notes. Additionally, this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations constitutes forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review our “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” at the front of this current report, and our “Risk Factors” set forth above.
Overview
Plan of Operations
In the next 12 months, we anticipate reaching a number of clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones. They include:
·
completing an international, multi-center Outcome Study;
·
obtaining clearance from the FDA to begin marketing and sales of the MPR System in the U.S.;
·
sign one or more distribution deals for the MPR System in North America and/or Europe; and,
·
begin sales in North America and Europe.
There are many challenges that we will encounter as we build our business. To meet these challenges, we believe it is important to assemble a team of experienced healthcare executives and medical opinion leaders to work with us to carry out the business and marketing plans of the Company. We also believe that to be successful in the development and commercialization of the MPR System, we must not only meet the milestones discussed above, but we must also:
·
Develop an awareness of MPR with physicians, employers, insurance companies, HMOs and other potential users of the MPR System;
·
Establish strong clinical and financial evidence of the key MPR value propositions through formal clinical studies representing our two target markets: North America and Europe;
·
Develop a template for consistent usage patterns of MPR in key reference accounts;
·
Establish a Reimbursement Support Services Team to assist our customers in their submissions for insurance reimbursement during the early stages of MPR market adoption;
·
Form relationships with key strategic partners with access to insurers, self-insured employers and other health care organizations that could use the MPR System;
·
Establish MPR in selected key reference accounts in geographic markets throughout Europe and the U.S., creating a delivery system to perform the tests as and where needed; and,
·
Form corporate alliances for the development, sales and marketing of MPR in a number of important yet opportunistic foreign markets that do not currently fall within our targeted geographic markets.
Funds currently available to us will not be adequate for us to complete these programs. We had $983,292 cash on hand as of December 31, 2010. We are in the development stage and have not earned any revenue since our inception. Therefore, we will need to raise additional funds in order to fully implement our business plan. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising such additional funds on favorable terms if at all. Regardless of whether our cash assets prove to be inadequate to meet our operational needs, we might seek to compensate providers of services by issuance of stock in lieu of cash.
Our continued operations therefore will depend upon our ability to raise additional funds through bank borrowings, equity or debt financing. Given the turbulence and volatility in the capital markets, there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional funding when needed, or that such funding, if available, can be obtained on terms acceptable to us. If we cannot obtain needed funds, we may be forced to curtail or cease our activities. We may encounter difficulty in obtaining these funds and/or credit lines. Moreover, even if additional financing or credit lines were to become available, it is possible that the cost of such funds or credit would be high and possibly prohibitive.
We continue to develop and enhance the features and performance of our technology with the goal of introducing new products based on our core research and development activities. Eight of our thirteen employees and one of our three independent consultants currently devote at least a portion of their time to our research and development activities. We anticipate increasing levels of resources will be dedicated to research and clinical development in the implementation of our business strategy within the next 12 months.
As our business grows, we anticipate hiring additional employees and retaining additional consultants.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We rely on historical experience and on other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances in making our judgment and estimates. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We consider our critical accounting policies to be those that are complex and those that require significant judgments and estimates, including the following: recognition of revenue, expensing of software development costs and valuation of our intangible assets and the determination of the valuation allowance of our deferred income taxes.
Long Lived Assets
Long-lived assets (primarily furniture and equipment and patents) are reviewed annually for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Impairment is necessary when the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the asset are less than the carrying amount of the asset.
Research and Development Costs
Costs and expenses that can be clearly identified as research and development are charged to expense as incurred in accordance with ASC 730, “Research and Development”.
Share-based Compensation
We have adopted the provisions of ASC 718 and have measured compensation cost related to stock options issued to employees at their fair value using the Black-Scholes method. Share-based payments issued to persons other than employees is also reflected in the financial statements at fair value computed using the Black-Scholes method.
Results of Operations - Fiscal Year 2010 Compared to Fiscal Year 2009
Revenues
We had no revenues in 2009 or 2010.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses increased to $483,592 in 2010 from $134,504 in 2009 due to increased activity related to the further development of the MPR System and the testing of the system to support our regulatory filings in North America and Europe.
We expense our research and developments costs as incurred. Research and development expenses consisted of costs associated with the design, development, testing, and enhancement of the MPR System. In January 2010, we signed a 5-year Research and Development Agreement with Salus Research, Inc., a Canadian-based contract research company, to carry out the majority of the R&D work related to the development and commercialization of the MPR System. The primary costs associated with the Salus Research agreement and our own internal R&D works are salaries, consulting fees and non-recurring software development costs. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Medical and Clinical Expenses
Medical and clinical expenses consisted of costs associated with the clinical study of the MPR System. The primary costs are salaries, consulting fees, clinical trial protocol development costs and clinical research organization costs. Medical and clinical expenses increased to $252,457 in 2010 from $181,500 in 2009. The increase from 2009 to 2010 is primarily due to the clinical trial at the Utah Spine and Joint Center that was completed in the third quarter of 2010.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses increased to $3,148,797 in 2010 from $2,612,279 in 2009 primarily due to an increase in all areas of operation of the Company. We received $2.56 million in new funding in 2010 that allowed us to continue the development and clinical research of the MPR System, including the completion of a 600-patient research study. The funds also allowed us to complete the work that led to our ISO 13485 Certification for quality standards, and approval of the MPR System in Europe and Canada.
Expenses related to the issuance of common stock and warrants for services decreased from $1,816,536 in 2009 to $1,665,021 in 2010. In July 2010, the Company agreed in to convert $125,000 in promissory notes from Frans Berndsen, one of its shareholders and an Affiliate, into common stock and warrants. This conversion resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $75,000. The difference between the face value of Mr. Berndsen’s loan and the fair value of the common stock ($200,000) was treated as compensation and included in general and administrative expenses. The fair value of the warrants given to Mr. Berndsen for the same transaction was $272,843, which is also included in general and administrative expenses. Mr. Berndsen and Wim Peters, a Director of the Company, received one million two hundred and fifty thousand (1,250,000) shares of common stock each as service fees for the Revox Ventures financing completed during 2010. This resulted in a general and administrative expense of $1,025,000 for the year ending December 31, 2010.
Interest Income and Expense
The interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased to $22,101 as compared with $484,255 for the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to the conversion of much of our short-term borrowings to common stock in 2009. Interest paid in cash decreased to $19,192 in 2010 from $74,898 for 2009.
Financial Condition, Capital Resources and Liquidity
We are in the development stage and have not earned any revenue since our inception. These factors have caused our auditors to express substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we incurred a net loss of $3,908,668 and $3,413,454, respectively.
At December 31, 2010, we had cash on hand of $983,292. We utilized cash of approximately $1,734,290 in the period ended December 31, 2010 compared to $483,732 for the same period ended December 31, 2009. The cash used in operating activities in 2010 is higher than 2009 due to the resumption of our research and clinical programs, the work that was required for our ISO 13485:2003 certification and the work that was required to file for commercial approval of the MPR System in North America and Europe. We have funded our operations primarily through private placements of equity securities. In 2010, we raised gross proceeds of approximately $115,515 from loans from related parties and $2,450,000 from the issuance of common stock.
We expect that we will require approximately $3.0 million of cash for operating activities in 2011. This is due primarily to the work required to complete the analytical work of the MPR software, the completion of the clinical trial program and the work associated with our regulatory filings. As of April 14, 2011 we current have approximately $275,000 which we expect to last us 60 days before we will require additional funds.
We will need to raise additional capital to support our projected increases in staffing and other operating expenses, which we cannot give any assurance we will be able to accomplish. If we are unable to raise additional capital, it will be necessary for us to significantly reduce expenses to stay in business. In addition, any new equity or debt financing that we secure may not be available to us at prices that would be acceptable. Our failure to reduce expenses or obtain necessary financing could impair our ability to stay in business. See “Risk Factors -- We may need to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available.”
Risk Factors
You should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision in our securities. These risk factors are effective as of the date of this Form 10-K and shall be deemed to be modified or superseded to the extent that a statement contained in our future filings incorporated herein by reference modifies or replaces such statement. All of these risks may impair our business operations. The forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K and in the documents incorporated herein by reference involve risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from the results we discuss in the forward-looking statements. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
We have a dispute with a large shareholder.
In April 2011, the Company received a demand from Revox for the issuance of additional shares of common stock and a reduction in the exercise price of certain of the warrants that it had received. Revox based this claim on the issuance by the Company of shares of common stock at a price lower than the price being paid by Revox for certain of its shares. Under the Stock Purchase Agreement with Revox, the Company has agreed that subject to certain conditions, if it issues shares for cash for financing purposes at prices less than the shares then being sold to Revox, Revox is entitled to the lower price for all of the shares purchased during that phase of the agreement, and that the exercise prices of warrants and purchase price for shares in later phases are proportionately reduced. The Company disputes Revox’s claim, and the Company and Revox are presently engaged in discussions regarding the claim. If Revox were to prevail on its claim, the Company believes that: (i) it would be obligated to issue to Revox approximately 702,703 additional shares of common stock; (ii) the exercise prices of approximately 8,000,000 warrants that Revox holds would be reduced by 26%; and (iii) the p the purchase price for shares in Phase II under the stock purchase agreement (should Revox elect to participate), and the exercise of the related warrants, would be reduced by approximately 26%.
We have a limited operating history and no revenues.
As a development stage company, our operations are subject to all the risks inherent in launching a new business enterprise, in developing and marketing a new product or service, and in establishing a name and a business reputation. The likelihood of our success must be considered in light of problems, expenses, difficulties and delays frequently encountered in converting prototype designs into viable production designs, and in achieving market acceptance with a new type of product or service. We have had no product revenues to date, have operated at a loss since inception, and will likely sustain operating losses for an indeterminate time period. There can be no assurance that we will ever generate material revenues or that we will ever be profitable.
We may need to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available.
During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we incurred a net loss of $3,908,668 and $3,413,454, respectively, and had $983,292 cash on hand as of December 31, 2010 and an accumulated deficit of $14,666,271. We are in the development stage and have not earned any revenue since our inception. Due to the foregoing facts, our auditors have expressed their doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Current funds available to us will not be adequate for us to complete our clinical program. Therefore, we will need to raise additional funds in order to fully implement our business plan. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising such additional funds. Regardless of whether our cash assets prove to be inadequate to meet our operational needs, we might seek to compensate providers of services by issuance of stock in lieu of cash.
Our continued operations therefore will depend upon our ability to raise additional funds through equity or debt financing. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional funding when needed, or that such funding, if available, can be obtained on terms acceptable to us. If we cannot obtain needed funds, we may be forced to curtail or cease our activities. We may encounter difficulty in obtaining these funds and/or credit lines. Moreover, even if additional financing or credit lines were to become available, it is possible that the cost of such funds or credit would be high and possibly prohibitive.
Your share ownership will be diluted if we issue shares for capital raising purposes.
A large portion of our financing to date has been through the issuance of shares or through equity financing. There can be no assurances that we will become self-sufficient. Therefore, we may continue to issue shares to further the business, and existing shareholders may suffer a dilutive effect on the price of their shares as well as a loss of voting power in the Company.
We operate in a new and uncertain market.
Until now, muscle injuries have always been diagnosed and evaluated subjectively by physicians through physical examination. Accordingly, there is no established demand for a computer assisted procedure to assist in the diagnosis of such injuries, and it is difficult to predict if, and when, the procedure will gain wide acceptance by prescribers. A prerequisite to our success will be our ability to establish MPR as a standard medical practice for use in the diagnosis of muscle dysfunction. We believe it will take a minimum of three to five years for such awareness to be achieved, if it can be achieved at all. Factors that may affect market acceptance could include resistance to change, concerns over the lack of track record of the procedure, and the risk for insurance companies to use the results of the procedure to challenge or overrule the diagnostic or treatment decisions of a physician.
We may not be able to protect important intellectual property, and we could incur substantial costs defending against claims that our products infringe on the proprietary rights of others.
We currently hold one United States patent on the MPR technology. While we believe that we have a proprietary position for our product, we believe that our ability to be successful will be contingent on our ability to protect the MPR technology, its future developments and its know-how. There can be no assurance, however, that this patent will provide substantial protection of the MPR technology or that its validity will not be challenged. We could incur substantial costs in prosecuting or defending patent infringement suits or otherwise protecting our intellectual property rights. While we have attempted to safeguard and maintain our proprietary rights, we do not know whether we have been or will be completely successful in doing so.
We presently have no patent protection of the MPR technology outside the United States.
We have only developed a single product and we have not made commercial sales of that product. The failure of such product to achieve market acceptance would result in our having to raise additional funds for research and development for new products.
Since our incorporation, we have been involved in the research and development of a single product: the Muscle Pattern Recognition System. The MPR System uses patented technology to analyze muscle function in the back and neck. To date, we have achieved no sales of this product and it has yet to achieve market acceptance. Unless we are able to successfully market the MPR System, we will need to raise additional funds to engage in the research and development of new products. We may be unable to raise additional funds on terms acceptable to us, if at all. We have a limited operating history and will continue to incur costs in launching our products.
We may not be able to grow at a rapid pace.
There is no established demand for the MPR System and we may be unable to create such a demand. We cannot predict whether or not the MPR System will gain acceptance by doctors, chiropractors or other health professionals. In the event we are unable to create such acceptance, we will be unable to achieve significant revenues and may have to raise additional funds for research and development of additional products.
Our management controls a substantial percentage of our stock and therefore has the ability to exercise substantial control over our affairs.
As of the date of December 31, 2010, our directors and executive officers owned or controlled an aggregate of 12,978,003 shares, or approximately 35.4%, of our outstanding common stock. Because of the large percentage of stock held by our directors and executive officers, these persons could influence the outcome of any matter submitted to a vote of our stockholders and resist any takeover bids, thereby precluding our stockholders from receiving a premium bid price on their common stock.
The loss of our executive officers and certain other key personnel could hurt our business.
Our success wholly depends upon the personal efforts and abilities of our executive officers, Steeve Asselin, Warren Baker, Wayne Cockburn, Alan Goldman and Karl Wolcott. The loss of or unavailability of the services of any one of these individuals would have a material adverse effect on our business prospects and/or potential earning capacity.
We may not be able to hire and retain qualified personnel.
Competition for qualified personnel in the healthcare industry is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. Failure to attract qualified personnel could harm the proposed growth of our business. In addition, companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that the competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices. We may receive such notices in the future as we seek to hire qualified personnel and such notices may result in material litigation and related disruption to our operations.
Because we became public by means of a reverse merger, we may not be able to attract the attention of major brokerage firms.
There may be risks associated with our becoming public through a “reverse merger.” Securities analysts of major brokerage firms may not provide coverage of us because there is no incentive to brokerage firms to recommend the purchase of our common stock. We cannot assure you that brokerage firms will ever want to conduct any secondary offerings on our behalf.
The limited prior public market and trading market may cause possible volatility in our stock price.
To date, there has only been a limited public market for our securities and there can be no assurance that we can attain an active trading market for our securities. Our common stock trades on the OTC Bulletin Board (“OTCBB”) under the ticker symbol, IMSU.OB. The OTCBB is an unorganized, inter-dealer, over-the-counter market that provides significantly less liquidity than the national securities exchanges.
Quotes for securities quoted on the OTCBB are not listed in the financial sections of newspapers as are those for the national securities exchanges. Moreover, in recent years, the overall market for securities has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of many smaller companies. The trading price of our common stock is expected to be subject to significant fluctuations including, but not limited to, the following:
·
Quarterly variations in operating results and achievement of key business metrics;
·
Changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts, if any;
·
Any differences between reported results and securities analysts’ published or unpublished expectations;
·
Announcements of new products by us or our competitors;
·
Market reaction to any acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic investments announced by us or our competitors;
·
Demand for our products;
·
Shares sold pursuant to Rule 144 or upon exercise of warrants and options; and
·
General economic or stock market conditions unrelated to our operating performance.
These fluctuations, as well as general economic and market conditions, may have a material or adverse affect on the market price of our common stock.
The OTCBB is a quotation system, not an issuer listing service, market or exchange. Therefore, buying and selling stock on the OTCBB is not as efficient as buying and selling stock through an exchange. As a result, it may be difficult for you to sell your common stock or you may not be able to sell your common stock for an optimum trading price.
The OTCBB executes trades and quotations using a manual process and cannot guarantee the market information for securities. In some instances, quote information, or even firm quotes, may not be available. The OTCBB’s manual execution process may delay order processing and as a result, a limit order may fail to execute or a market order may execute at a significantly different price due to intervening price fluctuations. Trade execution, execution reporting and legal trade confirmation delivery may be delayed significantly. Consequently, one may not be able to sell shares of our common stock at the optimum trading prices.
OTCBB securities are frequent targets of fraud or market manipulation not only because of their generally low price, but also because the OTCBB reporting requirements for these securities are less stringent than for listed or Nasdaq traded securities, and no exchange requirements are imposed. Dealers may dominate the market and set prices that are not based on competitive forces. Individuals or groups may create fraudulent markets and control the sudden, sharp increase of price and trading volume and the equally sudden collapse of the market price for shares of our common stock.
When fewer shares of a security are being traded on the OTCBB, the security’s market price may become increasingly volatile and price movement may outpace the ability to deliver accurate quote information. Due to lower trading volumes of our common stock, there may be a lower likelihood that one's orders for our common stock will be executed, and current prices may differ significantly from the price one was quoted by the OTCBB at the time of one's order entry.
Orders for OTCBB securities may be canceled or edited like orders for other securities. All requests to change or cancel an order must be submitted to, received and processed by the OTCBB. As mentioned earlier in this document, the OTCBB executes trades using a manual process, which could cause delays in order processing and reporting, and could hamper one’s ability to cancel or edit one's order. Consequently, selling shares of our common stock at the optimum trading prices may be impossible.
The dealer's spread (the difference between the bid and ask prices) may be large and may result in substantial losses to the seller of our common stock on the OTCBB if the stock must be sold immediately. Further, purchasers of our common stock may incur an immediate ""paper"" loss due to the price spread. Moreover, dealers may not have a bid price for our common stock on the OTCBB. Due to the foregoing factors, demand for our common stock on the OTCBB may be decreased or eliminated.
Our common stock is considered a “penny stock.” The application of the “penny stock” rules to our common stock could limit the trading and liquidity of the common stock, adversely affect the market price of our common stock and increase your transaction costs to sell those shares.
The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations which generally define a “penny stock” to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) of less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. As a result, our shares of common stock are subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell such securities to persons other than established clients and “accredited investors”. For transactions governed by these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of such securities, must obtain the purchaser's written consent to the transaction, and must deliver to the purchaser a SEC-mandated, penny stock risk disclosure document, all prior to the purchase. The broker-dealer must also disclose the commission payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and, if the broker-dealer is the sole market maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealer's presumed control over the market. Finally, monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks. Consequently, the “penny stock” rules may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell our shares of common stock and may affect the ability of investors to sell such shares of common stock in the secondary market and may affect the price at which investors can sell such shares.
Investors should be aware that the market for penny stocks has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse, according to the Commission. Such patterns include:
·
Control of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer;
·
Manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases;
·
“Boiler room” practices involving high pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced sales persons;
·
Excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differentials and markups by selling broker-dealers; and
·
The wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level, along with the inevitable collapse of those prices with consequent investor losses.
Our management is aware of the abuses that have occurred historically in the penny stock market.
Future sales of our common stock could put downward selling pressure on our common stock, and adversely affect the per share price. There is a risk that this downward pressure may make it impossible for an investor to sell shares of common stock at any reasonable price, if at all.
From time to time, certain of our stockholders may be eligible to sell all or some of their shares of common stock by means of ordinary brokerage transactions in the open market pursuant to Rule 144, promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act), subject to certain limitations. In general, Rule 144 permits the unlimited sale of securities by our stockholders that are non-affiliates that have satisfied a six month holding period and affiliates of our Company may sell within any three month period a number of securities that does not exceed 1% of our then outstanding shares of common stock. Any substantial sale of our common stock pursuant to Rule 144 or pursuant to any resale prospectus may have material adverse effect on the market price of our securities.
Limitations on director and officer liability and our indemnification of officers and directors may discourage shareholders from bringing suit against a director.
Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide, with certain exceptions as permitted by governing Delaware law, that a director or officer shall not be personally liable to us or our shareholders for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for acts or omissions which involve intentional misconduct, fraud or knowing violation of law, or unlawful payments of dividends. These provisions may discourage shareholders from bringing suit against a director for breach of fiduciary duty and may reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation brought by shareholders on our behalf against a director. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide for mandatory indemnification of directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law.
We may experience difficulties in the future in complying with Sarbanes-Oxley Sect",0

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis, as well as other sections in this Form 10-K, should be read in conjunction with the Partnership’s accompanying financial statements and related notes to the financial statements included in this report. Further, the Partnership encourages the reader to revisit the Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements on page one of the report.
Partnership Overview
PDC 2003-D Limited Partnership engages in the development, production and sale of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil. The Partnership began natural gas and crude oil operations in December 2003 and operates 43.0 gross (41.0 net) productive wells located in the Rocky Mountain Region in the state of Colorado. The Partnership drilled two wells (1.5 net wells) that were previously determined to be developmental dry holes. The Managing General Partner markets the Partnership’s natural gas production to commercial end users, interstate or intrastate pipelines or local utilities, primarily under market sensitive contracts in which the price of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil sold varies as a result of market forces. PDC does not charge an additional fee for the marketing of the natural gas, NGLs and crude oil because these services are covered by the monthly well operating charge. PDC, on behalf of the Partnership in accordance with the D&O Agreement, is authorized to enter into multi-year fixed price contracts or utilize derivatives, including collars, swaps or basis protection swaps, in order to offset some or all of the commodity price variability for particular periods of time. Seasonal factors, such as effects of weather on prices received and costs incurred, and availability of pipeline capacity, owned by PDC or other third parties, may impact the Partnership's results. In addition, both sales volumes and prices tend to be affected by demand factors with a seasonal component.

Recent Developments
PDC Sponsored Drilling Program Acquisition Plan
PDC, the managing general partner of various public limited partnerships, has disclosed its intention to pursue, beginning in the fall of 2010 and extending through the next three years, the acquisition of the limited partnership units (the “Acquisition Plan”) held by Investor Partners of that partnership other than PDC or its affiliates (“non-affiliated Investor Partners”), in the limited partnerships that PDC has sponsored, including this Partnership. For additional information regarding PDC’s intention to pursue acquisitions of PDC sponsored partnerships, refer to the disclosure included in Items 2.02, 7.01 and/or 8.01 of PDC’s Forms 8-K dated March 4, 2010, June 9, 2010, July 15, 2010 and November 17, 2010. However, such information shall not, by reason of this reference, be deemed to be incorporated by reference in, or otherwise be deemed to be part of, this report. Under the Acquisition Plan, any existing or future merger offer will be subject to the terms and conditions of the related merger agreement, and such agreement does or will likely contemplate the partnership being merged with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of PDC. Each such merger will also be subject to, among other things, PDC having sufficient available capital and the approval by a majority of the limited partnerships units held by the non-affiliated Investor Partners of each respective limited partnership. Consummation of any proposed merger of a PDC sponsored limited partnership under the Acquisition Plan will likely result in the termination of the existence of that partnership and the right of non-affiliated Investor Partners to receive a cash payment for their limited partnership units in that partnership.
In December 2010, PDC acquired four affiliated partnerships: PDC 2004-A Limited Partnership, PDC 2004-B Limited Partnership, PDC 2004-C Limited Partnership and PDC 2004-D Limited Partnership. PDC purchased these partnerships for the aggregate amount of $34.8 million.
In November 2010, PDC and a wholly-owned subsidiary of PDC entered into separate merger agreements with each of PDC 2005-A Limited Partnership, PDC 2005-B Limited Partnership, and the 2005 Rockies Region Private Limited Partnership (collectively, the “2005 partnerships”). PDC serves as the managing general partner of each of the 2005 partnerships. Definitive proxy statements for each of the 2005 partnerships requesting approval for the applicable merger were mailed to the non-affiliated Investor Partners of the 2005 partnerships on February 7, 2011. Pursuant to each merger agreement, if the merger is approved by the holders of a majority of the limited partnership units held by the non-affiliated Investor Partners of each respective partnership, as well as, the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions, then such partnership will merge with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of PDC. There is no assurance the partnerships will obtain the necessary approvals from non-affiliated investors. PDC has re-evaluated the merger consideration agreed to in the merger agreements and has proposed to offer supplemental merger consideration to the non-affiliated Investor Partners of the 2005 partnerships in addition to the merger consideration described above. On March 25, 2011, the special meeting of non-affiliated Investor Partners of the 2005 partnerships was adjourned until May 27, 2011. PDC expects to send non-affiliated Investor Partners of the 2005 partnerships a proxy supplement that provides information relating to the increased merger consideration and also includes such Partnership’s year-end financial statements and the Partnership’s 2010 year-end reserve report. Although there is no assurance of the likelihood or timing of the completion of the SEC proxy disclosure review process or whether each Partnership will obtain the necessary approvals from non-affiliated Investors Partners, PDC would expect to mail such proxy supplements to the non-affiliated Investors Partners of the 2005 partnerships in late April or early May.
The feasibility and timing of any future purchase offer by PDC to any additional partnership, including this Partnership, depends on that partnership’s suitability in meeting a set of criteria that includes, but is not limited to, the following: age and productive-life stage characteristics of the partnership’s well inventory; favorability of economics for Wattenberg Field well refracturing; and SEC reporting compliance status and timing associated with gaining all necessary regulatory approvals required for a merger and repurchase offer. There is no assurance that any merger and acquisition will occur, as a result of PDC’s proposed repurchase offers to the 2005 partnerships, or any potential proposed repurchase offer to any other of PDC’s various public limited partnerships, including this Partnership, should they occur.

Additional Codell Formation Development Plan. The Managing General Partner has prepared a plan for the Partnership’s Wattenberg Field wells which may provide for additional reserve development and natural gas, NGLs and crude oil production (the “Additional Codell Formation Development Plan”). The Additional Codell Formation Development Plan consists of the Partnership’s refracturing of wells currently producing in the Codell formation and the recompletion of wells, currently producing in the deeper J-Sand formation, in the shallower Codell formation production zone. Under the Additional Codell Formation Development Plan, the Partnership plans to initiate additional development activities during 2011. Refracturing, or “refracing,” activities consist of a second hydraulic fracturing treatment in a current production zone, while recompletion activities consist of an initial hydraulic fracturing treatment in a new production zone, all within an existing well bore.
Additional Codell formation development of Wattenberg Field wells, which may provide for additional reserve development and production, generally occurs five to ten years after initial well drilling so that well resources are optimally utilized. This additional Codell formation development would be expected to occur based on a favorable general economic environment and commodity price structure. The Managing General Partner has the authority to determine whether to recomplete or refracture the individual wells and to determine the timing of any additional Codell formation development activity. The timing of the additional development can be affected by the desire to optimize the economic return by recompleting or refracturing of the wells when commodity prices are at levels to obtain the highest rate of return to the Partnership. On average, the production resulting from PDC's Codell recompletions or refracturings have been at modeled economics; however, all recompletions or refracturings have not been economically successful and similar future recompletion or refracturing activities may not be economically successful. If the additional Codell formation development work is performed, PDC will charge the Partnership for the direct costs of recompletion or refracturing, and the Investor Partners and the Managing General Partner will each pay their proportionate share of costs based on the ownership sharing ratios of the Partnership from funds retained by the Managing General Partner from distributable cash flows.
During the fourth quarter 2010, the Managing General Partner began withholding funds from several of the PDC sponsored partnerships, on a pro-rata basis allocated to the Managing General Partner and Investor Partners based on their proportional ownership interest, from distributable cash flows of the Partnership resulting from current production. The funds retained are necessary for the Partnership to pay for additional Codell formation development costs and will materially reduce, up to 100%, distributable cash flows of the Partnership for a period of time not to exceed five years. If any or all of the Partnership’s Wattenberg wells are not refractured or recompleted, the Partnership will experience a reduction in proved reserves currently assigned to these wells. Both the number and timing of the additional Codell formation development activities will be based on the availability of cash withheld from Partnership distributions. The Managing General Partner believes that, based on projected refracturing and recompletion costs and projected cash withholding, all scheduled Partnership additional Codell formation development activity will be completed within a five year period. This Partnership has not begun to withhold funds for this additional Codell formation development as this Partnership has outstanding payables to the Managing General Partner.
Current estimated costs for these well refracturings and recompletions are between $175,000 and $240,000 per activity. As of December 31, 2010, this Partnership has scheduled to complete 29 additional Codell formation development opportunities. Total withholding for these activities from the Partnership’s distributable cash flows is estimated to be between $5.1 million and $7.0 million. The Managing General Partner will continually evaluate the timing of commencing these additional Codell formation development activities based on engineering data and a favorable commodity price environment in order to maximize the financial benefit of the additional well development. As of December 31, 2010 and through February 28, 2011, no funds have been withheld from the Partnership distributions for this recompletion and refracturing.
Implementation of the Additional Codell Formation Development Plan would reduce or eliminate Partnership distributions to the Managing General Partner and Investor Partners while the work is being conducted and paid for. Depending upon the level of withholding and the results of operations, it is possible that the Managing General Partner and Investor Partners could have taxable income from the Partnership without any corresponding distributions in future years. Non-affiliated Investor Partners are urged to consult a tax advisor to determine all of the relevant federal, state and local tax consequences of the Additional Codell Formation Development Plan. The above discussion is not intended as a substitute for careful tax planning, and non-affiliated Investor Partners should depend upon the advice of their own tax advisors concerning the effects of the Additional Codell Formation Development Plan.

2010 and 2009 Partnership Overview
Natural gas, NGLs and crude oil sales increased 11% or $0.2 million for the 2010 annual period compared to 2009, even though production volumes decreased 11% period-to-period. This revenue increase was supported primarily by the improved commodity price environment. The average sales price per Mcfe, excluding the impact of realized derivative gains, was $5.26 during 2010 compared to $4.21 for 2009. Comparatively, the total per Mcfe price realized, consisting of the average sales price and realized derivative gains, decreased to $6.27 during 2010 from $7.25 during 2009. This decrease was primarily due to realized derivative gains from natural gas and crude oil sales contributing only $1.01 per Mcfe or $0.4 million to the 2010 total revenues as compared to $3.04 per Mcfe or $1.4 million to 2009 total revenues. The Partnership’s 2010 revenues were favorably impacted by unrealized derivative gains on natural gas and crude oil sales of $0.8 million in 2010 as compared to unrealized losses of $2.1 million in 2009.
The Partnership’s combined natural gas and crude oil production expenses and direct costs−administrative and general, increased by $1.1 million during 2010. Higher production expenditures were primarily due to environmental remediation activities during 2010 while higher administrative and general expenses were due to higher fees for professional services.
The Partnership recorded an impairment loss of $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The impairment loss resulted from the downward revision to the future net cash flows of production activities in the Grand Valley Field in Colorado. See Note 10, Impairment of Capitalized Costs to the accompanying financial statements for additional disclosure related to the Partnership’s proved property impairment.
Reporting on NGLs in 2010
As the Partnership embarks on the Additional Codell Formation Development Plan, the Managing General Partner believes that the NGLs will be an increased percentage of the Partnership’s total revenues and production volumes in future years. Additionally, as a result of a computer system upgrade during the second half of 2009, the Managing General Partner was able to accumulate the Partnership’s NGLs sales revenues and production volumes for 2010. Prior to the system upgrade, the Partnership’s NGLs sales revenues and production volumes were included in the natural gas sales revenues and production volume statistical information. The NGLs are extracted by third-party purchasers, from the Partnership’s natural gas production after delivery. To provide additional information to the reader, the Partnership has shown all of the NGLs revenue and production volume statistical data separately for 2010. For comparability when discussing 2010 results with 2009, the Partnership has added the 2010 NGLs sales revenue and natural gas equivalent production volumes with the relevant 2010 natural gas activity data and compared it to the 2009 natural gas results. Reporting the Partnership’s information in this fashion, gives comparability to readers when discussing the Partnership’s year to year results and provides more detailed information which may be beneficial for understanding the Partnership’s current business. Starting in the first quarter of 2011, all of the Partnership’s revenues and production volumes of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil will be presented in a fashion comparable to the 2010 information contained in this report.

Results of Operations
Summary Operating Results
The following table presents selected information regarding the Partnership’s results of operations. Prior to 2010, NGLs were included in natural gas, which impacts the comparability of natural gas production, natural gas sales and natural gas average sales price for 2010 to 2009. However, total Mcfe production, total sales and Mcfe average price is comparable. See the previous discussion in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations−Reporting on NGLs in 2010 for additional details.
*Percentage change not meaningful, equal to or greater than 250% or not calculable. Amounts may not calculate due to rounding.

Natural Gas, NGLs and Crude Oil Sales
Changes in Natural Gas, NGLs and Crude Oil Production Volumes. For the 2010 annual period compared to the 2009 annual period, natural gas, NGLs and crude oil production, on an energy equivalency-basis, decreased 11% due to normal production declines for this stage in the wells’ production life cycle, the Wattenberg Field production reduction that resulted from a well equipment issue and lower Grand Valley Field well performance at some wells due to intermittent field operational constraints.
Changes in Natural Gas and NGLs Sales. During 2010, the Partnership began separate reporting of NGL sales, which were previously classified and reported as a component of natural gas sales revenues. Combined 2010 natural gas and NGL sales were $0.2 million, or 15% higher than comparably reported 2009 natural gas sales revenues. Combined production from natural gas and NGLs were 343,257 Mcfe in 2010 compared to 377,410 Mcfe in 2009. This 34,153 Mcfe or 9% reduction in production was more than offset by the higher average selling price for these commodities of $3.79 per Mcfe in 2010 compared to $2.99 in 2009. This $0.80 per Mcfe increase represents a 27% overall price increase from the prior year.
Changes in Crude Oil Sales. Crude oil sales for the 2010 annual period as compared to the 2009 annual period remained stable at $0.9 million, which was primarily the reflection of a higher average sales price per Bbl of 32% that was offset by the production volume decrease of 21%. The average sales price per Bbl, excluding the impact of realized derivative gains, was $72.29 for the current year annual period compared to $54.78 for the same period a year ago.
Natural Gas, NGLs and Crude Oil Pricing. The Partnership’s results of operations depend upon many factors, particularly the price of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil and on PDC’s ability to market the Partnership’s production effectively. Natural gas, NGLs and crude oil prices are among the most volatile of all commodity prices. These price variations have a material impact on the Partnership’s financial results. Natural gas and NGLs prices vary by region and locality, depending upon the distance to markets, and the supply and demand relationships in that region or locality and availability of sufficient pipeline capacity. This can be especially true in the Rocky Mountain Region. The combination of increased drilling activity and the lack of local markets have resulted in local market oversupply situations from time to time. Like most producers in the region, the Partnership relies on major interstate pipeline companies to construct these pipelines to increase capacity, rendering the timing and availability of these facilities and transportation capacity beyond the Partnership’s control. Crude oil pricing is driven predominantly by the physical market, supply and demand, the financial markets and politics.
The price at which PDC markets the natural gas produced in the Rocky Mountain Region by the Partnership is based on a variety of prices, which primarily includes natural gas sold at Colorado Interstate Gas, or CIG, prices with a portion sold at Mid-Continent, San Juan Basin, Southern California or other nearby regional prices. The CIG Index, and other indices for production delivered to other Rocky Mountain pipelines, has historically been less than the price received for natural gas produced in the eastern regions, which is primarily New York Mercantile Exchange, or NYMEX, based, because of the lack of interstate transmission capacity which moved Rocky Mountain natural gas production to Northeastern U.S. industrial and heating markets. This negative differential has narrowed in the last few years and is lower than historical variances. The negative differential between NYMEX and CIG averaged $0.47 and $0.92 for 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Commodity Price Risk Management, Net
Commodity price risk management, net, includes realized gains and losses and unrealized changes in the fair value of derivative instruments related to the Partnership’s natural gas and crude oil production. See Note 3, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, and Note 4, Derivative Financial Instruments, to the Partnership’s financial statements included in this report for additional details of the Partnership’s derivative financial instruments.
The following table presents the realized and unrealized derivative gains and losses included in commodity price risk management gain (loss), net.
Realized gains recognized in 2010 and 2009 are a result of lower natural gas and crude oil spot prices at settlement compared to the respective strike price, offset in part by the negative basis differential between NYMEX and CIG being narrower than the strike price of the Partnership’s derivative position. During 2010, the Partnership recorded unrealized gains of $1.0 million on the Partnership’s natural gas and crude oil positions that were partially offset by unrealized losses of $0.1 million on its CIG basis swaps as the forward basis differential between NYMEX and CIG had continued to narrow from the prior year.
During 2009, the Partnership recorded unrealized losses on its CIG basis swaps as the forward basis differential between NYMEX and CIG had continued to narrow from the prior year along with unrealized losses on the Partnership’s crude oil positions, offset by unrealized gains on the Partnership’s natural gas positions.
Natural Gas and Crude Oil Sales Derivative Instruments. The Partnership uses various derivative instruments to manage fluctuations in natural gas and crude oil prices. The Partnership has in place a variety of floors, collars, fixed-price swaps and basis swaps on a portion of the Partnership’s estimated natural gas and crude oil production. Because the Partnership sells its physical natural gas and crude oil at similar prices to the indexes inherent in the Partnership’s derivative instruments, the Partnership ultimately realizes a price related to its collars of no less than the floor and no more than the ceiling and, for the Partnership’s commodity swaps, the Partnership ultimately realizes the fixed price related to its swaps. See Note 3, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, and Note 4, Derivative Financial Instruments, to the Partnership’s financial statements included in this report on how each derivative type impacts the Partnership’s cash flows and detailed presentation of the Partnership’s derivative positions as of December 31, 2010.

As of December 31, 2010, approximately 4% of the fair value of the Partnership’s derivative assets and all of the Partnership’s derivative liabilities were measured using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3).
Natural Gas, NGLs and Crude Oil Production Costs
Natural gas, NGLs and crude oil production costs include production taxes and transportation costs which vary with revenues and production, well operating costs charged on a per well basis and other direct costs incurred in the production process. As production declines, fixed costs increase as a percentage of total costs resulting in production costs per unit increases. Typically, as production is expected to continue to decline, production costs per unit can be expected to increase in the future until such time as the Partnership successfully recompletes the Wattenberg Field wells.
Generally, natural gas, NGLs and crude oil production costs vary with changes in total natural gas, NGLs and crude oil sales and production volumes. Production taxes are estimates by the Managing General Partner based on tax rates determined using published information. These estimates are subject to revision based on actual amounts determined during future filings by the Managing General Partner with the taxing authorities. Production taxes vary directly with total natural gas, NGLs and crude oil sales. Transportation costs vary directly with production volumes. Fixed monthly well operating costs increase on a per unit basis as production decreases per the historical decline curve. In addition, general oil field services and all other costs vary and can fluctuate based on services required but are expected to increase as wells age and require more extensive repair and maintenance. These costs include water hauling and disposal, equipment repairs and maintenance, snow removal and service rig workovers.
Changes in natural gas, NGLs and crude oil production expenses. Production and operating costs were higher by approximately $0.5 million during 2010 compared to 2009, due in part, to the nonrecurring environmental remediation expenses of $0.4 million, which includes a December 31, 2010 accrual of $0.1 million. Additionally 2010 Partnership lease operating expenses were higher as a result of higher Grand Valley fluid disposal and hauling costs, while well operations costs were higher as a result of the increase in the per well operations fee charged by the Managing General Partner, consistent with the terms of the D&O Agreement. These production expense increases were partially offset by volume-associated reductions in production taxes, natural gas transportation and lease operating expenses due to the production volume declines previously noted in the section, Natural Gas, NGLs and Crude Oil Sales. Production and operating costs per Mcfe rose to $3.41 during 2010 compared to $1.96 during 2009 due to the effect of higher per-well related expenditures offset by lower per-volume related natural gas, NGLs and crude oil production costs.

Direct Costs−General and Administrative
Direct costs - general and administrative consist primarily of professional fees for financial statement audits, income tax return preparation, independent engineer’s reserve reports and legal matters. Direct costs increased during the 2010 annual period compared to the 2009 annual period, by approximately $0.6 million principally due to increased fees for professional services related to the Partnership’s SEC reporting compliance efforts.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization
Natural gas and crude oil properties. Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense related to natural gas and crude oil properties is directly related to proved reserves and production volumes. DD&A expense is primarily based upon year-end proved developed producing reserves. The pricing measurement for reserve estimations is a 12-month average of the first day of the month price for each month in the period. If prices increase, the estimated volumes of proved reserves will increase, resulting in decreases in the rate of DD&A per unit of production. If prices decrease, the estimated volumes of proved reserves will decrease, resulting in increases in the rate of DD&A per unit of production.
Changes in DD&A expense. The DD&A expense rate per Mcfe decreased to $4.03 during 2010 compared to $4.38 during 2009. The DD&A rate decrease was due to the changing production mix between the Partnership’s Wattenberg and Grand Valley Fields, which have significantly different DD&A rates, in addition to the effect of the upward revision in the Partnership’s Wattenberg Field’s proved developed producing natural gas, NGLs and crude oil reserves at December 31, 2009. The decreased DD&A expense rate, combined with the effect of the production decline noted in previous sections, resulted in a decreased DD&A expense of approximately $0.4 million for 2010 compared to 2009.
Loss on Impairment of Natural Gas and Crude Oil Properties
The Partnership assesses its proved natural gas and crude oil properties for possible impairment, upon a triggering event, by comparing net capitalized costs to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows on a field-by-field basis using estimated production based upon prices at which the Managing General Partner reasonably estimates the commodities to be sold. The Partnership considers the receipt of the annual reserve report from independent engineers to be a triggering event. Therefore, impairment tests are completed as of December 31 each year. The estimates of future prices may differ from current market prices of natural gas and crude oil. Certain events, including but not limited to, downward revisions in estimates to the Partnership’s reserve quantities, expectations of falling commodity prices or rising operating costs, could also result in a triggering event and, therefore, a possible impairment of the Partnership’s proved natural gas and crude oil properties. If during the completion of the impairment test, net capitalized costs exceed undiscounted future net cash flows, as occurred for the year ended December 31, 2010, the measurement of impairment is based on estimated fair value utilizing a future discounted cash flows analysis, which is predominantly unobservable data or inputs (Level 3), and is measured by the amount by which the net capitalized costs exceed their fair value. The Partnership’s estimated production used in the impairment testing is taken from the annual reserve report (See Supplemental Natural Gas, NGL and Crude Oil Information -Unaudited-Net Proved Reserves). Estimated undiscounted future net cash flows are determined using prices from the forward price curve at the measurement date. Estimated discounted future net cash flows were determined utilizing a risk adjusted discount rate that is based on rates utilized by market participants that are commensurate with the risks inherent in the development of the underlying natural gas and crude oil reserves. A decline in the forward price curves used to estimate future cash flows at December 31, 2010 accompanied by lower reserves reflected in the Partnership’s annual reserve report resulted in an impairment in the fourth quarter of 2010. This downward revision to the future net cash flows resulted primarily from a 1,088 or 36.1% decrease in future estimated MMcfs of natural gas production due to well economics and a reduction in prices from 2009. The Partnership recorded an impairment loss of $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The Partnership recognized no impairment of its natural gas and crude oil properties as of December 31, 2009. The 2010 impairment loss resulted from the downward revision to the fair value of discounted future net cash flows of production activities in the Grand Valley Field in Colorado. The Partnership has recognized impairment losses from inception to December 31, 2010 of $11.9 million on its natural gas and crude oil properties since the Partnership began operating in 2003.

Financial Condition
Capital Resources and Liquidity
The Partnership’s primary sources of cash for both the 2010 and the 2009 annual periods were from funds provided by operating activities which include the sale of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil production and the realized gains from the Partnership’s derivative positions. These sources of cash were primarily used to fund the Partnership’s operating cost, general and administrative activities and provided monthly distributions to the Investor Partners and PDC, the Managing General Partner.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The Fund records all investments at market value in its financial statements, with changes in market value reported as a component of realized and change in unrealized trading gain (loss) in the Statements of Operations. In certain circumstances, estimates are involved in determining market value in the absence of an active market closing price.
Capital Resources
The Fund will raise additional capital only through the sale of Units offered pursuant to the continuing offering, and does not intend to raise any capital through resale of Units once issued or borrowing. Due to the nature of the Fund’s business, it will make no capital expenditures and will have no capital assets which are not operating capital or assets.
Liquidity
Most United States commodity exchanges limit fluctuations in commodity futures contracts prices during a single day by regulations referred to as “daily price fluctuation limits” or “daily limits”. During a single trading day, no trades may be executed at prices beyond the daily limit. Once the price of a futures contract has reached the daily limit for that day, positions in that contract can neither be taken nor liquidated. Commodity futures prices have occasionally moved to the daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no trading. Similar occurrences could prevent the Fund from promptly liquidating unfavorable positions and subject the Fund to substantial losses which could exceed the margin initially committed to such trades. In addition, even if commodity futures prices have not moved the daily limit, the Fund may not be able to execute futures trades at favorable prices, if little trading in such contracts is taking place. Other than these limitations on liquidity, which are inherent in the Fund’s commodity futures trading operations, the Fund’s assets are expected to be highly liquid.
See Item 2 of this Report for a description of where Fund assets will be held. Investors should note that maintenance of the Fund’s assets in U.S. government securities and banks does not reduce the risk of loss from trading futures and options on futures contracts. The Fund receives all interest earned on its assets. No other person shall receive any interest or other economic benefits from the deposit of Fund assets.
Approximately 10% to 40% of the Fund’s assets normally are committed as required margin for futures contracts and held by the futures broker, although the amount committed may vary significantly. Such assets are maintained in
the form of cash or U.S. Treasury bills in segregated accounts with the futures broker pursuant to the Commodity Exchange Act and regulations thereunder.
The Fund’s assets are not and will not be, directly or indirectly, commingled with the property of any other person in violation of law or invested with or loaned to the Fund, the Managing Member or any affiliated entities.
Results of Operations
The initial start-up costs attendant to the sale of Units by use of a Prospectus which has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission are substantial. The Operating Agreement grants solely to the Managing Member the right to select the CTAs and to otherwise manage the operation of the Fund. See the Registration Statement, incorporated by reference herein, for an explanation of the operation of the Fund.
On July 7, 2011, the Fund commenced business after admission of 26 limited partners, with total subscriptions of $1,374,333. As of December 31, 2012, aggregate subscriptions were $2,761,531. Because the Fund was not operational prior to July 7, 2011, the Fund believes it would be misleading to compare the year ended 2012 to the full years ended 2011 and 2010. Also, see Subsequent Events in Part I, Item 1 of this report.
For non-financial reporting purposes (subscription and redemption purposes), the Fund's initial net asset value (NAV) per Unit of $1,000 decreased to $922.14, a loss of (7.79)%, from the commencement of operations into year end December 31, 2011 (the “Partial Year 2011”); and, during the year 2012, it decreased to $687.92, a loss of (25.40)%. During both periods, the losses were primarily as a result of operational expenses, which were $(121,966) in the Partial Year 2011 and $(250,964) in 2012. During the Partial Year 2011, the Fund's net assets increased to $1,796,875, primarily as a result of capital contributions by Members of $2,155,371, offset partially by redemptions of $(239,611). During 2012, the Fund’s net assets decreased to $585,664, primarily as a result of redemptions of $(1,225,860), offset partially by capital contributions of $601,159.
Going forward, any positive revenue is expected to be primarily derived from the trading of the trading advisor until short term interest rates rise and contribute non-negligibly. The trading advisor’s objective is to achieve appreciation of the Fund's assets through speculative trading in futures contracts and options on futures contracts. There is no representation being made that the trading programs offered by the trading advisor will be successful in achieving this goal.
Money managers generally rely on either fundamental or technical analysis, or a combination thereof, in making trading decisions and attempting to identify price trends in a commodity interest. ""Fundamental analysis"" is the consideration of factors external to the market of a particular instrument. For example, weather and political events which affect the supply and demand of that particular instrument, in order to predict future prices of that instrument. As an example, some of the fundamental factors that affect the supply of commodities (e.g., agricultural products such as corn and soybeans) include the acreage planted, weather during the growing season, harvesting and distribution of the commodity and the previous year's crop carryover. The demand for such commodities is determined in part by domestic consumption and exports and is a product of many factors, including general world economic conditions, exports and the cost of competing products which might be substituted as alternate sources of food or fiber.
Technical analysis is not based on the anticipated supply and demand of the ""cash"" or ""physical"" (i.e., actual) commodity; instead, technical analysis is based on the theory that a study of the markets themselves (in particular, of trends of prices established by the markets for various instruments during selected historical periods) provides a means of anticipating prices. Technical analysis of the markets often includes a study of the actual daily, weekly and monthly price fluctuations, as well as volume variations and changes in open interest, utilizing charts and/or computers for analysis of these items and other technical market data. Both general methodologies have been employed with success by traders and investors in the past, however, neither trading method can be assured of success in a particular interval of time.
If a large price movement occurs in a sector that a trading advisor trades, such as stock indices, agriculture, financials, metals or softs, it does not necessarily mean that the trading advisor will engage in trades that capture
such moves. Accordingly, market movements and conditions are not necessarily correlated with Fund performance. As always, past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.
Interest income was negligible during the reporting period because of low short term interest rates.
These results are not to be construed as an expectation of similar profits or losses in the future.
Off-Balance Sheet Risk
The term “off-balance sheet risk” refers to an unrecorded potential liability that, even though it does not appear on the balance sheet, may result in future obligation or loss. The Fund trades in futures and options on futures contracts and is therefore a party to financial instruments with elements of off-balance sheet market and credit risk. In entering into these contracts there exists a risk to the Fund, market risk, that such contracts may be significantly influenced by market conditions, such as interest rate volatility, resulting in such contracts being less valuable. If the markets should move against all of the futures interests positions of the Fund at the same time, and if the Fund’s trading advisor was unable to offset futures interests positions of the Fund, the Fund could lose all of its assets and the Members would realize a 100% loss. The Fund, the Managing Member and the CTAs minimize market risk through real-time monitoring of open positions, diversification of the portfolio and maintenance of a margin-to-equity ratio that rarely exceeds 40%.
In addition to market risk, in entering into futures and options on futures contracts there is a credit risk that a counterparty will not be able to meet its obligations to the Fund. The counterparty for futures contracts traded in the United States and on most foreign exchanges is the clearinghouse associated with such exchange. In general, clearinghouses are backed by the corporate members of the clearinghouse who are required to share any financial burden resulting from the non-performance by one of their members and, as such, should significantly reduce this credit risk. In cases where the clearinghouse is not backed by the clearing members, like some foreign exchanges, it is normally backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions.
All positions of the Fund are valued each day on a mark-to-market basis. There can be no assurance that any clearing member, clearinghouse or other counterparty will be able to meet its obligations to the Fund.",0

As used herein, the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Weatherford International plc (“Weatherford Ireland”), a public limited company organized under the laws of Ireland, and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in “Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Our discussion includes various forward-looking statements about our markets, the demand for our products and services and our future results. These statements include certain risks and uncertainties. For information about these risks and uncertainties, refer to the section entitled “Forward-Looking Statements” and the section entitled “Item 1A. - Risk Factors.”
Overview
General
We conduct operations in over 80 countries and have service and sales locations in virtually all of the oil and natural gas producing regions in the world. Our operational performance is reviewed on a geographic basis, and we report the following as separate, distinct reporting segments: Western Hemisphere and Eastern Hemisphere.
Our principal business is to provide equipment and services to the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry, both onshore and offshore. Products and services include: (1) Production, (2) Completions, (3) Drilling and Evaluation and (4) Well Construction.
•
Production offers production optimization services and a complete production ecosystem, featuring our artificial-lift portfolio, testing and flow-measurement solutions, and optimization software, to boost productivity and profitability.
•
Completions is a suite of modern completion products, reservoir stimulation designs, and engineering capabilities that isolate zones and unlock reserves in deepwater, unconventional, and aging reservoirs.
•
Drilling and Evaluation comprises a suite of services ranging from early well planning to reservoir management. The drilling services offer innovative tools and expert engineering to increase efficiency and maximize reservoir exposure. The evaluation services merge wellsite capabilities including wireline, logging while drilling, and surface logging with laboratory-fluid and core analyses to reduce reservoir uncertainty.
•
Well Construction builds or rebuilds well integrity for the full life cycle of the well. Using conventional to advanced equipment, we offer safe and efficient tubular running services in any environment. Our skilled fishing and re-entry teams execute under any contingency from drilling to abandonment, and our drilling tools provide reliable pressure control even in extreme wellbores. During 2018, we disposed of our Kuwait and Saudi Arabia land drilling rigs operations. Our remaining land drilling rig business is part of Well Construction and nearly all our remaining land drilling rigs assets were classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2018.
We may sell our products and services separately or may bundle them together to provide integrated solutions up to, and including, integrated well construction where we are responsible for the entire process of drilling, constructing and completing a well. Our customers include both exploration and production companies and other oilfield service companies. Depending on the service line, customer and location, our contracts vary in their terms, provisions and indemnities. We earn revenues under our contracts when products are delivered and services are performed. Typically, we provide products and services at a well site where our personnel and equipment may be located together with personnel and equipment of our customer and third parties, such as other service providers. Our services are usually short-term in nature, day-rate based and cancellable should our customer wish to alter the scope of work. Consequently, our backlog of firm orders is not material to the Company.
Industry Trends
The level of spending in the energy industry is heavily influenced by the current and expected future prices of oil and natural gas. Changes in expenditures result in an increased or decreased demand for our products and services. Rig count is an indicator of the level of spending for the exploration for and production of oil and natural gas reserves. The following chart sets forth certain statistics that reflect historical market conditions:
(a)
Price per barrel of West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) crude oil as of the last business day of the year indicated at Cushing Oklahoma - Source: Thomson Reuters
(b)
Price per MM/BTU as of the last business day of the year indicated at Henry Hub Louisiana - Source: Thomson Reuters
(c)
Average rig count - Source: Baker Hughes Rig Count
During 2018 oil prices ranged from a low of $42.53 per barrel in late December to a high of $76.41 per barrel in early October on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Natural gas ranged from a low of $2.55 MM/BTU in mid-February to a high of $4.84 MM/BTU in mid-November. Factors influencing oil and natural gas prices during the period include hydrocarbon inventory levels, realized and expected global economic growth, realized and expected levels of hydrocarbon demand, level of production capacity and weather and geopolitical uncertainty.
Outlook
Our results for 2018 improved in the Western Hemisphere primarily due to higher demand for our products and services in well construction, production, and drilling services as the average rig count increased and supplies tightened, combined with the positive impact from our transformation initiatives. The high volatility in oil prices will continue to negatively impact customer buying behavior and their demand for our services. North America growth was led by the Permian Basin, and apart from increasing activity in Argentina, the overall market activity in Latin America remained relatively subdued. In the Eastern Hemisphere, we experienced continued growth in the Gulf Cooperation Council (“GCC”) countries mainly as a result of market share gains and increased activity levels in Russia while Africa, Asia and Europe remained relatively stable. We believe certain deepwater markets in the Eastern Hemisphere have likely reached their bottom, with little expected improvements in the near term. Our expectations, however, regarding diligent improvement, are measured from continued volatility in oil prices and the overall market contraction for our products and services.
In the absence of any geopolitical events, we believe our industry will remain within this ‘medium-for-longer’ price level paradigm for some time, until production growth is moderated. In the interim, we expect continuous short-term cyclical fluctuations. We will continue to push innovation, both from a technological and a business model perspective, and we will deliver operational excellence to bring the cost of production down to a point at which all market participants can make acceptable returns. For us, this means continuous focus on our transformation program, which started late in the fourth quarter of 2017, generating cost savings through the flattening of our organizational structure, driving process changes, improving the capabilities and the efficiency of our supply chain, sales and general administrative organizations and continuing to rationalize our manufacturing footprint. Furthermore, through our transformation program we will continue to see improvements in our operating efficiency, ongoing lowering of our non-productive time, improvements in our collaboration with our customers and continuing our steady progress towards our transformation targets.
As production decline rates accelerate and reservoir productivity complexities increase, our clients will continue to face challenges associated with decreasing the cost of extraction activities and securing desired rates of production. These challenges increase our customers’ requirements for technologies that improve productivity and efficiency, which in turn puts pressure on us to deliver our products and services at competitive rates. We believe we are well positioned to satisfy our customers’ needs, but the level of improvement in our businesses in the future will depend heavily on pricing, volume of work and our ability to offer solutions to more efficiently extract hydrocarbons, control costs and penetrate new and existing markets with our newly developed technologies.
For 2019, our North American customers are expected to have a flat or lower capital spending primarily related to the pricing pressures related to the hydraulic fracturing market and its associated sub-sectors, where we are relatively insulated from due to
our disposition of our pressure pumping business in the fourth quarter of 2017. The slowdown in activity in Canada as result of high crude oil price differentials is also expected to lead to lower revenue in the short term. We expect activity levels in Latin America to remain constructive, as additional contract wins will support our continued growth, partly offset by inflationary pressures in Argentina. In the Eastern Hemisphere, we anticipate growth in the North Sea, Continental Europe and in the GCC countries as a result of an increase in activity combined with some market share growth. We expect activity levels in Russia, Africa, and Asia to remain relatively stable.
We continually seek opportunities to maximize efficiency and value through various transactions, including purchases or dispositions of assets, businesses, investments or joint ventures. In the first quarter of 2018, we acquired the remaining interest in our Qatari joint venture that we now consolidate. In July of 2018, we entered into purchase and sale agreements to sell our land drilling rig operations in Algeria, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia as well as two idle land rigs in Iraq, to ADES International Holding Ltd. (“ADES”), for a gross purchase price of $287.5 million. During the second quarter of 2018, we also committed to plans to divest certain remaining land drilling rigs operations and other business operations for which we believe a sale is probable within the next twelve months. In the third quarter of 2018, we completed the sale of an equity investment in a joint venture for $12.5 million. In October of 2018, we agreed to sell our Reservoir Solutions business, also known as our laboratory services business to an affiliate of CSL Capital Management, L.P., for an aggregate purchase price of $205 million, subject to customary post-closing working capital adjustments. In December of 2018, we agreed to sell our Surface Data Logging business to Excellence Logging for $50 million in cash, subject to customary post-closing working capital adjustments. We evaluate our disposition candidates based on the strategic fit within our business and/or our short and long-term objectives. Divestitures, however, can be complex and may be affected by unanticipated developments, such as the significant decrease in crude oil prices in the fourth quarter of 2018 and delays in obtaining regulatory, customer or third party approvals, which may result in the consummation of such divestitures, if agreed upon, being delayed or terminated, which could have a negative impact on our liquidity position, ability to repay indebtedness and comply with certain covenants in our debt instruments.
Upon completion, the cash proceeds from any divestitures are expected to be used for working capital or repay or repurchase debt. Any such debt reduction may include the repurchase of our outstanding senior notes prior to their maturity in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. We continue to be mindful of our debt and its maturities and we are evaluating options to ensure that our balance sheet and capital structure is aligned with our business and the long-term health of our company.
The oilfield services industry growth is highly dependent on many external factors, such as our customers’ capital expenditures, world economic and political conditions, the price of oil and natural gas, member-country quota compliance within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and weather conditions and other factors, including those described in the section entitled “Forward-Looking Statements” and the section entitled “Item 1A. - Risk Factors.”
Opportunities and Challenges
Our industry offers many opportunities and challenges. The cyclicality of the energy industry impacts the demand for our products and services. Certain of our products and services, such as our drilling and evaluation services, well construction and well completion services, depend on the level of exploration and development activity and the completion phase of the well life cycle. Other products and services, such as our production optimization and artificial lift systems, are dependent on the number of wells and the type of production systems used. We have created a long-term strategy aimed at growing our businesses, servicing our customers, and creating value for our shareholders. The success of our long-term strategy will be determined by our ability to manage effectively any industry cyclicality, including the ongoing and prolonged industry downturn and our ability to respond to industry demands and periods of over-supply or low oil prices, successfully maximize the benefits from our acquisitions and complete the disposition of businesses that are no longer a strategic fit within our business and/or our short and long term objectives. There is no assurance that we will be able to execute on our long-term strategy or achieve its intended benefits.
Overview of Significant Activities
Divestitures
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed the sale for a portion of the land drilling rigs operations we previously committed to divesting in the fourth quarter of 2017 and received gross cash proceeds of $216 million. Proceeds from the sale were used to reduce outstanding indebtedness. The sale represents two of a series of four closings pursuant to the purchase and sale agreements entered into with ADES in 2018 to sell our land drilling rig operations in Algeria, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, as well as two idle land rigs in Iraq, for a total of 31 land rigs and related drilling contracts, as well as transferring employees and contract personnel, for an aggregate purchase price of $287.5 million, subject to regulatory approvals, consents and other customary closing conditions including potential adjustments based on working capital, net cash, loss or destruction of rigs and drilling contract backlog.
In December of 2018, we agreed to sell our surface data logging business to Excellence Logging for $50 million in cash, subject to customary post-closing working capital adjustments. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2019.
In October of 2018, we agreed to sell our Reservoir Solutions business, also known as our laboratory services business to an affiliate of CSL Capital Management, L.P., for an aggregate purchase price of $205 million in cash, subject to customary post-closing working capital adjustments. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2019.
In December of 2017, we completed the sale of our U.S. pressure pumping and pump-down perforating assets for $430 million in cash and recognized a $96 million gain on this sale. We sold our related facilities, field assets, and supplier and customer contracts related to these businesses. Proceeds from the sale were used to reduce outstanding indebtedness.
Summary of Operating Charges
For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded $1.9 billion of goodwill impairment charges related to our annual fair value assessment of our business and assets, $151 million of long-lived asset impairments, $126 million of severance and restructuring charges and $89 million of other asset write-downs.
For the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred $928 million of long-lived asset impairments, $540 million inventory write-off and other related charges including excess and obsolete, $230 million in the write-down of Venezuelan receivables and $183 million of severance and restructuring charges.
For the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred $436 million related to long-lived asset impairments, $280 million of severance and restructuring charges, $220 million of litigation charges, $269 million of inventory write-downs and $194 million of asset-write downs and other charges primarily for pressure pumping related charges related to the shutdown of our U.S. pressure pumping business.
Goodwill and Long-lived Asset Impairments
During 2018, we recorded a goodwill impairment of $1.9 billion which was based upon our annual fair value assessment of our business and assets. The rapid and steep decline in oil prices and consequentially lower expectations for future exploration and production capital spending, resulted in a sharp reduction in share prices in the oilfield services sector, including our share price, which triggered the goodwill impairment in line with U.S. GAAP. During 2018, we also recognized long-lived asset impairments of $151 million related to our land drilling rigs assets primarily to write-down our land drilling rigs assets to the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. The 2018 impairments were due to the sustained downturn in the oil and gas industry that resulted in a reassessment of our disposal groups for our land drilling rigs. The change in our expectations of the market’s recovery, in addition to successive negative operating cash flows in certain disposal asset groups represented an indicator that those assets will no longer be recoverable over their remaining useful lives.
During 2017, we recognized long-lived asset impairments of $928 million, of which $923 million was related to property, plant and equipment (“PP&E”) impairments and $5 million was related to the impairment of intangible assets. The PP&E impairments include a $740 million write-down to the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell of our land drilling rigs classified as held for sale, $172 million related to segment product line assets and $11 million of long-lived impairments charges related to Corporate assets. The 2017 impairments were due to the sustained downturn in the oil and gas industry, whose recovery was not as strong as expected and whose recovery in subsequent quarters was slower than had previously been anticipated. The change in the expectations of the market’s recovery, in addition to successive negative operating cash flows in certain asset groups represented an indicator that those assets will no longer be recoverable over their remaining useful lives.
During 2016, we recognized long-lived asset impairments of $436 million of which $388 million was related to product line PP&E impairments and $48 million was related to the impairment of intangible assets. The 2016 impairments were due to the prolonged downturn in the oil and gas industry, whose recovery was not as strong as expected and whose recovery in subsequent quarters in 2016 was slower than had previously been anticipated. The change in the expectations of the market’s recovery, in addition to successive negative operating cash flows in certain asset groups represented an indicator that those assets will no longer be recoverable over their remaining useful lives.
See “Note 9 - Long-Lived Asset Impairments,” “Note 10 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets” and “Note 13 - Fair Value of Financial Instruments, Assets and Other Assets” for additional information regarding goodwill and long-lived asset impairments.
Recent Litigation Settlements
In 2016, the SEC and DOJ continued to investigate certain accounting issues associated with the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting for income taxes and the restatements of our historical financial statements in 2011 and 2012. As disclosed in a Form 8-K filed on September 27, 2016, the Company agreed to pay the SEC a total civil monetary penalty of $140 million to resolve the investigation. In addition, certain reports and certifications regarding our internal controls over accounting for income taxes were delivered to the SEC during the two years following the settlement. We have completed these reports as of April 2018 and our final payment for the civil monetary penalty was made in September 2017. For additional information about this resolution, see “Note 20 - Disputes, Litigation and Legal Contingencies.”
Debt Transactions and Equity Issuances
In February of 2018, we repaid in full our 6.00% senior notes due March 2018. On February 28, 2018, we issued $600 million in aggregate principal amount of our 9.875% senior notes due 2025.
The February 2018 debt offering partially funded a concurrent tender offer to purchase for cash any and all of our 9.625% senior notes due 2019. We settled the tender offer in cash for the amount of $475 million, retiring an aggregate face value of $425 million and accrued interest of $20 million. In April 2018, we repaid the remaining principal outstanding on an early redemption of the bond. We recognized a cumulative loss of $34 million on these transactions in “Bond Tender and Call Premium” on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.
In June of 2017, we repaid our 6.35% senior notes on the maturity date. On June 26, 2017, we issued an additional $250 million aggregate principal amount of our 9.875% senior notes due 2024. These notes were issued as additional securities under an indenture pursuant to which we previously issued $540 million aggregate principal amount of our 9.875% senior notes due 2024.
During 2016, through a series of debt offerings we received net proceeds of $3.7 billion from the issuance of various unsecured debt instruments and a secured term loan. We used certain proceeds from our debt offerings to fund tender offers to buy back our senior notes with a principal balance of $1.9 billion and used the remaining proceeds to repay our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. We recognized a cumulative loss of $78 million on the tender offers buyback transaction.
During 2016, we received total cash proceeds of $1.1 billion from the issuance of 200 million ordinary shares of the Company. In addition, in November 2016 we issued one warrant that permits the holder to purchase 84.5 million ordinary shares on or prior to May 21, 2019 at an exercise price of $6.43 per ordinary share.
See “Note 11 - Short-term Borrowings and Other Debt Obligations” and “Note 12 - Long-term Debt” for additional details of our financing activities.
Results of Operations
The following table contains selected financial data comparing our consolidated and segment results from operations for 2018, 2017 and 2016. See “Note 22 - Segment Information” for additional information regarding variances in operating income.
Revenues Percentage by Product Lines
The following table contains the percentage distribution of our consolidated revenues by product lines for 2018, 2017 and 2016:
Consolidated and Segment Revenues
2018 vs 2017 Revenues
Consolidated revenues increased $45 million, or 1%, in 2018 compared to 2017.
•
Western Hemisphere revenues improved $126 million, or 4%, in 2018 compared to 2017 on higher activity levels in all product lines in the U.S. and an improved product mix for the Production and Completions product lines in the U.S. Growth in Latin America was driven by higher demand for Integrated Services and Projects and improved activity levels in Latin America. These improvements were partially offset by lower activity in Canada due to a general slowdown and increasing crude oil differentials.
•
Eastern Hemisphere revenues declined $81 million, or 3%, in 2018 compared to 2017, respectively. The modest decline in revenues was primarily due to fewer offshore projects in West Africa, the North Sea and Asia, partially offset with increased activity and higher product sales in the Gulf Cooperation Countries.
2017 vs 2016 Revenues
Consolidated revenues decreased $50 million, or 1%, in 2017 compared to 2016. Excluding revenues from U.S. pressure pumping operations and our Zubair project in Iraq, consolidated revenues increased 5% in 2017 compared to 2016.
•
Western Hemisphere revenues declined slightly by $5 million in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to lower activity concentrated in Argentina, Venezuela and Brazil in Drilling and Evaluation and Completions, the impact of the shutdown of our U.S. pressure pumping operations in the fourth quarter of 2016, as well as the negative impact from the change in accounting for revenue in Venezuela. Western Hemisphere revenues, excluding U.S. pressure pumping operations, improved $245 million, or 9%, in 2017 compared to 2016. These improvements were driven by higher activity and sales in the U.S. and Canada related to the 46% increase in North American rig count since December 31, 2016 as well as improvements across all our product lines in Colombia benefiting from an increase in the number of operating rigs.
•
Eastern Hemisphere revenues declined $45 million, or 2%, primarily due to lower activity related to the Zubair project, a non-renewal of a contract in the United Arab Emirates and overall lower demand for services and continued pricing pressures for Well Construction. Throughout the Asia markets we had a broad decline in demand across our product lines. Eastern Hemisphere revenues, excluding early production facility operations, improved $30 million, or 1%, in 2017 compared to 2016. This improvement was driven by improved customer activity in Russia for Drilling Services, Pressure Pumping and Well Construction operations, a full year for our Drilling Rigs contract in Algeria as well as overall improvements in Kuwait.
Consolidated and Segment Operating Results
2018 vs 2017 Operating Results
Consolidated operating results improved $86 million, or 4%, in 2018 compared to 2017 and segment operating income of $327 million improved $579 million, or 230%, in 2018 compared to 2017. Our consolidated operating loss improvement was primarily due to the following:
•Higher activity and productivity related to the increase in Western Hemisphere rig count;
•
Higher utilization in our product lines, improved sales mix and the continued realization of savings from cost reduction measures related to headcount reductions and facility closures, and lower depreciation and amortization due to decreased capital spending;
•
Through our transformation program we have improved our segment operating income following the positive structural changes, improvements in our operating efficiency, ongoing lowering of our non-productive time, improvements in our collaboration with our customers by continuing our steady progress on our transformation initiatives: and
•
Lower long-lived asset impairments and asset write-downs compared to 2017.
Western Hemisphere 2018 segment operating income of $208 million improved $321 million, or 284% compared to 2017. The improvement was driven by Production, Completions and Well Construction activity increases in the U.S. with a profitable product mix, and a decline in operating costs as a result of our transformation efforts. Operating income also improved due to growth in Latin America driven by higher demand for Integrated Services and Projects and improved activity levels in Latin America across all product lines. These improvements were partially offset by lower operating results in Canada as a result of the difficult macro environment and adverse foreign exchange rate impacts in Latin America.
Eastern Hemisphere 2018 segment operating income of $119 million improved $258 million, or 186%, compared to 2017. The improvement is primarily a result of improved product mix, a reduced cost structure and improved service quality resulting in greater operational efficiency.
2017 vs 2016 Operating Results
Consolidated operating results improved $75 million, or 3%, in 2017 compared to 2016 and segment operating loss improved $312 million, or 55%, in 2017 compared to 2016. Our consolidated operating loss improvement was primarily due to the following:
•Higher activity and productivity related to the increase in Western Hemisphere rig count;
•
Higher utilization in our product lines, improved sales mix and the continued realization of savings from cost reduction measures related to headcount reductions and facility closures, and lower depreciation and amortization due to decreased capital spending.
•
Long-lived asset impairments, write-downs and charges increased in 2017, offset by reduced litigation and restructuring charges;
•Reduced expenses from the shutdown of our U.S. pressure pumping operations; and
•A gain on sale of $96 million the U.S. pressure pumping assets.
The Western Hemisphere segment operating loss improved $294 million, or 72%, in 2017 compared to 2016. The improvement was due to increased activity levels in North America for Artificial Lift, Well Construction, Completions and Drilling Services, cost savings from facility closures and cost reductions as a result of the shutdown of our U.S. pressure pumping operations at the end of 2016. Offsets to the improvement were the deterioration of results in Venezuela as a result of the change in revenue accounting, the difficult geopolitical situation and lower revenue in Argentina and Brazil, and the suffering from pricing pressures and reduced demand for our products and services in most product lines.
The Eastern Hemisphere segment operating loss improved $18 million, or 11%, in 2017 compared to 2016. The improvement was primarily due to higher activity and increased utilization rates in Russia, North Africa, parts of the Middle East, Continental Europe and the North Sea combined with lower costs related to the Zubair project in Iraq. These improvements were partially offset by a non-renewal of a contract in the United Arab Emirates, continued pricing pressure across most of our businesses as well as a decline in activity in offshore markets in Asia and Africa.
Interest Expense, Net
Net interest expense was $614 million in 2018 compared to $579 million in 2017. This increased interest expense of $35 million, or 6%, was primarily as result of higher average borrowings, higher average interest rates in 2018 and lower interest income.
Net interest expense was $579 million in 2017 compared to $499 million in 2016. This increased interest expense of $80 million, or 16%, was primarily due to a full year of interest expense on higher interest rates from the senior notes and exchangeable notes issued in 2016.
Warrant Fair Value Adjustment
We recorded a warrant fair value income of $70 million and $86 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, related to the fair value adjustment to our warrant liability. The change in fair value of the warrant during 2018 was primarily driven by eliminating the warrant share value associated with any future equity issuance and a decrease in Weatherford’s stock price. The change in fair value of the warrant during 2017 was principally due to a decrease in Weatherford’s stock price.
Other Income (Expense), Net
We incurred other expense of $46 million in 2018, other income of $7 million in 2017 and other expense of $30 million in 2016. In 2018, other expense was primarily driven by foreign currency exchange losses, letter of credit fees, other financing fees and non-service periodic pension and other post-retirement benefit expenses. In 2017, other income was primarily due to gains associated from our supplemental executive retirement plan and non-service periodic pension and other post-retirement benefit expenses partially offset by foreign currency exchange losses, letter of credit and other financing fees. In 2016, other expense was primarily driven by foreign currency exchange losses. Foreign exchange losses are typically due to the strengthening U.S. dollar compared to our foreign denominated operations.
Currency Devaluation Charges
For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized currency devaluation charges of $49 million primarily related to the devaluation of the Angolan kwanza due to a change in Angolan central bank policy in 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we had no significant currency devaluation charges. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized currency devaluation charges of $41 million to include charges related to the Angolan kwanza of $31 million and the Egyptian pound of $10 million. Currency devaluation charges are included in current earnings in “Currency Devaluation Char",1
"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contain statements concerning certain trends and other forward-looking information, within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Such forward-looking statements are subject to uncertainties and factors relating to the Company’s operations and business environment, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of the Company. The Company believes that the following factors, among others, could affect its future performance and cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company: (1) weather conditions, particularly in the Great Lakes region, and/or water levels; (2) fluctuations in energy, fuel and oil prices; (3) fluctuations in integrated steel production in the Great Lakes region; (4) fluctuations in Great Lakes and Mid-Atlantic construction activity; (5) a change in economic conditions or population growth rates in southern California; (6) the outcome of periodic negotiations of labor agreements; (7) the loss or bankruptcy of major customers or insurers; (8) changes in environmental laws and (9) an increase in the number and cost of asbestos and silica product liability claims filed against the Company and its subsidiaries and determinations by a court or jury against the Company’s interest. Fluctuations in oil prices have both a positive and negative impact on the Company. High oil prices generally result in more drilling activity, positively impacting the Company’s Performance Minerals business segment, while at the same time increasing the operating costs of the Company’s vehicles, vessels and processing plants. Some of the Company’s customers have filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Management does not expect these reorganizations to have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition.
Management’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operation are based upon the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent liabilities. On a continual basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to accounts receivable reserves, inventories, intangible assets, impairment and useful lives of long-lived assets, pensions and other postretirement benefits, restructuring and voluntary early retirement program reserves and commitments and contingencies. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.
Accounts Receivable
The Company is required to estimate the collectability of its trade and note receivables. A considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables. The Company has increased its reserve for doubtful accounts in recent periods and if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, additional reserves may be required.
Contingencies
The Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims related to environmental, labor, product and other matters. The Company is required to estimate the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. Determinations of the amounts or reserves required, if any, for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue. The required reserves may change in the future because of new developments in each matter or changes in approach, such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters.
Postretirement Benefits
The Company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs and credits are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates and expected return on plan assets. We consider current market conditions, including changes in interest rates, the age of our workforce and retirees, current health care costs and other factors, in selecting these assumptions. The Company has made changes to these assumptions in recent periods and future postretirement benefit costs or credits may change based upon changes in these assumptions.
Restructuring and Impairment Charges
During 2001, the Company recognized two separate charges for restructuring and a voluntary early retirement program. Inherent in these charges were estimates related to the settlement of contractual obligations and estimates related to the incremental postretirement benefits awarded to retirees. Additionally, the Company recognized asset impairment charges during 2002 and 2001. The impairment of fixed assets included estimating fair value less cost to sell.
Please review Note A to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete description of the Company’s significant accounting policies.
Financial Condition
Acquisition - Subsequent Event
In the first quarter of 2003, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common shares of Erie Sand and Gravel Company, Inc. (Erie Sand and Gravel) for $6,831,000 in cash and $4,069,000 in assumed debt, which was refinanced at closing. Erie Sand and Gravel operates a dock, a Great Lakes vessel, a ready-mix concrete mixing facility and a trucking company that distributes construction sand and aggregates in the northwest Pennsylvania/western New York region. The assets and results of operations of Erie Sand and Gravel will be included within the Company’s Great Lakes Minerals segment. The acquisition of Erie Sand and Gravel is another strategic step in further driving the Company’s Great Lakes strategy and is expected to strengthen the Company’s leadership position on the Great Lakes.
Liquidity
The Company’s operating activities provided cash of $17,998,000 in 2002, which was a decrease of 23% compared with $23,245,000 in 2001. Cash from operations during 2002 decreased 55% when compared with $39,913,000 for 2000. The decrease in operating cash provided between 2002 and 2001 is primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable and inventory, partially offset by $7,855,000 in income tax refunds received by the Company during 2002. The decrease in operating cash provided between 2002 and 2000 is primarily attributed to decreased net income, increased accounts receivable, increased cash interest payments, including settlement costs on interest rate hedges, increased costs to provide retirement benefits and the annual contingent payment on the Michigan Limestone acquisition which was first paid in 2001, partially offset by income tax refunds received by the Company.
Expenditures for property and equipment amounted to $20,016,000 in 2002 compared with $26,875,000 and $36,048,000 in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The decreases in capital expenditures between the three years are primarily the result of cost controlling measures intended to conserve capital. Expenditures for the replacement of existing property and equipment totaled approximately $11,887,000 in 2002. Expansion projects amounted to $5,111,000, with the remaining $3,018,000 balance for quarry development. Expenditures for property and equipment for 2003 are currently expected to approximate $25,000,000. Management expects that the proportion of 2003 capital expenditures for expansion projects, replacement and quarry development will be consistent with 2002 levels. The increase is primarily because of required vessel inspections on three of the Company’s vessels in 2003.
Capital Resources
In October 2002, the Company executed a $75,000,000 Senior Secured Notes agreement and amended its $207,000,000 Senior Credit Facility and $118,000,000 Syndicated Term Loan. Proceeds from the Notes transaction were used to reduce the Senior Credit Facility to $147,000,000. The amendments extend the maturity date of the Senior Credit Facility and Syndicated Term Loan to October 31, 2004 and do not require principal prepayments. In addition, the amendments increase the applicable margin charged the Company on its LIBOR based interest rate by 50 basis points and establish less restrictive quarterly covenant levels. The variable interest rates on the Senior Credit Facility and the Syndicated Term Loan approximated 6.0% at December 31, 2002.
Financial Condition-(Continued)
The pricing features and covenants of the Senior Credit Facility and the Syndicated Term Loan are the same. The most restrictive covenants on the Senior Credit Facility and Syndicated Term Loan require the Company to maintain a (1) minimum level of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), (2) maximum leverage ratio, (3) minimum cash flow coverage ratio, (4) minimum interest coverage ratio (5) minimum level of net worth and (6) limitation on capital expenditures and prohibition of the payment of cash dividends by the Company. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2002.
The $75,000,000 Senior Secured Notes mature on October 25, 2008 with scheduled amortization in 2007 and 2008 (50% of the original principal in each year). Interest on the notes includes a 13% per annum cash payment, payable quarterly, and a 5% per annum payment-in-kind. The Senior Secured Notes contain financial covenants that, though similar in nature, are less restrictive than those of the Senior Credit Facility and Syndicated Term Loan.
Both the Senior Credit Facility and Syndicated Term Loan are secured by liens senior to the liens securing the Senior Secured Notes. The Senior Credit Facility, Syndicated Term Loan and Senior Secured Notes are senior to the Company’s $100,000,000 Senior Subordinated Notes which mature in February 2009 and have a fixed interest rate of 10%.
At December 31, 2002, the Company had $48,334,000 available for use on the Senior Credit Facility. Anticipated cash flows from operations and current financial resources are expected to meet the Company’s needs during 2003. All financing alternatives are under constant review to determine their ability to provide sufficient funding at the least possible cost.
In 2002, the Company incurred $8,413,000 of deferred financing costs related to the execution of the Senior Secured Notes agreement and amendment of the Senior Credit Facility and Syndicated Term Loan. In 2001, the Company incurred $1,734,000 of deferred financing costs related to the amendment of the Senior Credit Facility and Syndicated Term Loan. In 2000, the Company incurred $1,220,000 of deferred financing costs related to the creation of the Syndicated Term Loan and extension of the Senior Credit Facility. The deferred financing costs are being amortized over the terms of the respective agreements and are included in Other Assets on the consolidated balance sheet.
In 2002, the Company’s additional borrowings exceeded debt repayments by $6,576,000, while, in 2001 and 2000, the Company’s additional borrowings exceeded debt repayments by $10,295,000 and $74,950,000, respectively. Additional borrowings in 2002 were used primarily for financing costs related to the execution of the Senior Secured Notes agreement and amendment of the Senior Credit Facility and Syndicated Term Loan as well as to fund higher interest costs. 2001 additional borrowings were primarily used to fund capital expenditures, cash dividend payments, higher interest costs and financing costs related to the 2001 amendment of the Senior Credit Facility and Syndicated Term Loan. Additional borrowings in 2000 were primarily used for financing the Michigan Limestone and Global Stone Portage acquisitions.
The Company’s Senior Credit Facility requires interest rate protection on fifty-percent of the Company’s senior secured debt. Accordingly, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements in 2000 to limit the effect of increases in the interest rates on variable rate debt. The differential between fixed and variable rates is recorded as an increase or decrease to interest expense. The effect of these agreements was to fix the Company’s interest rate exposure, including the applicable margin charged the Company on its LIBOR based interest rate, at 11.12% on the Senior Credit Facility and Syndicated Term Loan. At December 31, 2002, the Company’s derivatives have maturities ranging from April 3, 2003 through June 30, 2004.
As a result of falling LIBOR based interest rates, interest expense increased to $9,967,000 and $5,176,000 in 2002 and 2001, respectively, because of these interest rate swaps. Additionally, the Company’s other expense increased $7,000 in 2002 and $3,096,000 in 2001. The $3,096,000 charge in 2001 primarily represents the mark-to-market valuation of swaps that did not qualify as hedging instruments under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (SFAS No. 133)
Financial Condition-(Continued)
during the first quarter of 2001. Interest expense decreased by $723,000 in 2000 because of these interest rate swaps. See Note F to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of the Company’s swap agreements.
The following tables provide information about the Company’s derivative and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates, which include interest rate swaps and debt obligations. For debt obligations, the table presents cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. For interest rate swaps, the table presents notional amounts and weighted average LIBOR interest rates by contractual maturity dates. Notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract. Weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward LIBOR rates in the yield curve, plus a 4.25% margin in 2002 and a 3.75% margin in 2001 for variable rate long-term debt. The Company does not hold or issue financial instruments for speculative purposes.
In 2002, the Company received proceeds of $2,304,000 from the sale of non-strategic mineral processing operations in the Performance Minerals segment and other miscellaneous asset sales. In connection with the sale of non-strategic mineral processing operations, $959,000 (or $0.12 per share net loss, assuming dilution) of proceeds received in excess of the net book value of the underlying assets was recorded within the provision for restructuring, asset impairments and early retirement programs on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Additionally, the Company recorded pretax gains of $55,000 in 2002 related to other miscellaneous asset sales. In 2001 and 2000 the Company received proceeds of $326,000 and $1,731,000, respectively, and recorded pretax gains of $64,000 and $1,907,000, respectively, from miscellaneous asset sales.
The Company did not declare a cash dividend during 2002, as 2001 and 2002 amendments to the financial covenants of the Company’s Senior Credit Facility and Syndicated Term Loan prohibit the payment of cash dividends. The Company declared dividends of $0.60 per share during 2001 and $0.80 per share during 2000. Dividends paid were $2,983,000 in 2001 and $3,972,000 in 2000.
Financial Condition-(Continued)
At December 31, 2002, the Company re-evaluated assumptions used in determining postretirement pension and health care benefits. The weighted-average discount rate was adjusted from 7.25% to 7.00% to better reflect market rates. The decrease resulted in an increase in the projected benefit obligation of $2,230,000 for the pension plans and $1,580,000 for the postretirement benefit plan. Though the change in the discount rate will increase the Company’s pension and postretirement expense in 2003, the impact is not expected to be material. The fair value of the Company’s pension plan assets declined $18,564,000 during 2002, and that decline is estimated to result in $1,910,000 in additional pension expense in 2003.
At December 31, 2001, the Company revised the weighted-average discount rate from 8.0% to 7.25%. The revised discount rate resulted in an increase in the projected benefit obligation of $6,128,000 for the pension plans and $4,620,000 for the postretirement benefit plan. The Company’s fair value of pension plan assets declined by $10,328,000 during 2001, and that decline resulted in approximately $1,250,000 in additional pension expense in 2002. At December 31, 2000, the Company revised the expected annual trend rate increase in the per capita cost of health care benefits from 7.3% to 9.0%. The revised trend rate increased the Company’s postretirement benefits projected benefit obligation by $4,189,000 at December 31, 2000. In 2000, the Company’s liability and expense resulting from the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992 was reduced by $2,135,000 primarily as a result of a decline in the number and change in the mix of beneficiaries assigned to the Company.
In conjunction with the Company’s 2001 annual meeting, the Company’s stockholders approved the re-incorporation of the Company as an Ohio corporation and certain changes to the Company’s capital structure. The changes included an increase in the number of authorized shares from 10,000,000 to 30,000,000 and the replacement of existing unissued preferred stock with 5,000,000 shares of “blank check” preferred stock. The term “blank check” preferred stock refers to stock for which designations, preferences, conversion rights, participation and other rights, including voter rights (subject to some limitations established by law), qualifications, limitations, and restrictions may be determined by the board of directors. The articles of incorporation establish restrictions on the blank check preferred stock relating to the conversion price and the number of common shares into which the preferred stock may be converted in order to limit the dilution to holders of common stock. No blank check preferred stock was issued or outstanding at December 31, 2002.
The Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer Michael D. Lundin was one of the former owners of Michigan Limestone Operations Limited Partnership (Michigan Limestone), which the Company acquired during the second quarter of 2000. Mr. Lundin’s share of the Michigan Limestone purchase price at closing was $9,858,000, of which he received $4,858,000 after paying loans and expenses related to the transaction. Additionally, Mr. Lundin receives an 18.6% share of contingent payments, which totaled $571,000, $568,000 and $592,000 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Mr. Lundin was not an executive officer of the Company prior to the Michigan Limestone acquisition.
In the fourth quarter 2002, the Company agreed with its insurers to fund settlement and defense costs arising out of asbestos litigation, effective April 1, 2003, to the extent an insurer is insolvent. On March 31, 2003, the Company anticipates receiving the remaining funds on certain insurance policies covering certain of such liabilities, which the Company will use to fund its share of settlements in 2003. Management does not anticipate its share of such liabilities in 2003 to exceed the amount of insurance proceeds it will receive; however, management recorded a reserve for such liabilities based upon historic settlement levels. Even after receipt of these funds, the Company continues to have in place multiple layers of insurance from multiple providers.
Results of Operations
The Company’s net sales and operating revenues in 2002 of $400,572,000 were 1% less than the 2001 level of $404,211,000 and were 2% greater than the 2000 level of $393,181,000. Operating income increased to $34,625,000 in 2002 compared with $15,208,000 in 2001 and decreased in comparison to $51,019,000 in 2000. The Company reported a net loss for 2002 of $6,608,000 (or $1.32 per share, assuming dilution) compared to a net loss of $18,815,000 ($3.76 per share, assuming dilution) for 2001 and net income of $15,028,000 (or $3.00 per share, assuming dilution) for 2000.
The decrease in net sales and operating revenues in 2002 compared with 2001 is primarily attributable to lower volume demand for fracturing sands, the closure of three non-strategic operating locations as part of the fourth quarter 2001 restructuring and lower volume demand for building materials in the Performance Minerals segment and lower volume demand for fillers from the carpet and flooring markets and lower lime sales in the Oklahoma regional market in the Global Stone segment. These decreases to net sales and operating revenues were partially offset by increased demand for fillers sold to the roofing and glass markets from the Company’s James River and Global Stone Portage facilities, increased demand for lawn and garden products, increased volume to the steel industry from the Company’s Chemstone and Winchester facilities and Great Lakes Minerals selling a higher percentage of its limestone at a delivered price, including freight. The increase in net sales and operating revenues between 2002 and 2000 is primarily attributable to the timing of the Global Stone Portage acquisition in September of 2000, whose effects are partially offset by the 2002 trends identified above. Adjusting for the timing of the Global Stone Portage acquisition, net sales and operating revenues in 2000 were comparable to 2001 levels. Based on macroeconomic forecasts, the Company expects GDP growth to be in the 2% to 3% range for 2003 and, as such, is expecting low, single-digit growth in net sales and operating revenues, excluding acquisitions and dispositions.
Operating income in 2002 compared with 2001 increased primarily because of a one-time, pretax charge for restructuring, asset impairments and early retirement programs in 2001 of $16,068,000 (or $1.97 per share net loss, assuming dilution) and cessation of goodwill amortization in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (SFAS No. 142), which the Company adopted during the first quarter of 2002. Adjusting for goodwill amortization and the prior-year, one-time charge, operating income as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues increased to 9% in 2002 compared with 8% in 2001. The Company improved operating margins between 2002 and 2001 by planned cost reductions and productivity enhancements, benefits from its 2001 restructuring efforts and efficiencies from its Great Lakes Minerals segment’s pooling arrangement with American Steamship. The decrease in operating income between 2002 and 2000 can be attributed to higher general and administrative costs as a result of increased costs to provide retirement benefits, increased fuel costs, decreased fracturing sand sales, more weather related delay days and fewer sailing days on the Great Lakes. The Company expects that operating income will improve in 2003, as a result of continued cost reductions, productivity enhancements and benefits from the pooling arrangement with American Steamship. However, the extent of improvement is dependent on the general economy.
The decrease in net loss in 2002 compared with 2001 resulted from higher operating income in 2002 and one-time, pretax charges in 2001 of $7,251,000 (or $0.88 per share net loss, assuming dilution) for the adoption of SFAS No. 133 and to establish a reserve against an unsecured note receivable, partially offset by increased interest expense and a one-time charge in 2002 of $2,408,000 (or $0.29 per share net loss, assuming dilution) to reserve for product liability claims. The decrease in net income between 2000 and 2002 resulted from decreased operating income, increased interest expense and the 2002 one-time charge. The Company expects interest
Results of Operations-(Continued)
expense to increase to $49,000,000 in 2003 because of approximately $4,200,000 in increased amortization of deferred financing costs resulting from the execution of the Senior Secured Notes agreement and amendment to the Senior Credit Facility and Syndicated Term Loan during 2002 and a higher average fixed interest rate resulting from the Company’s Senior Secured Notes.
The Company operates its businesses as three reporting segments focused on its key markets served. The segments align operations that share business strategies and that are related by geography and product mix and reflects the way management evaluates the operating performance of its business. The operations are reported as: Great Lakes Minerals, which is the largest and only fully integrated producer and bulk transporter of limestone on the Great Lakes and combines the Company’s Michigan Limestone and Marine Services operations; Global Stone, whose lime, limestone fillers, chemical limestone, construction aggregate and lawn and garden product businesses operate primarily in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions; and Performance Minerals, which mines and processes specialized industrial minerals, primarily high-purity silica sands and muscovite mica. The operating results of the Company’s business segments for 2002, 2001 and 2000 are discussed below.
Great Lakes Minerals
Net sales and operating revenues for the Great Lakes Minerals segment increased 3% to $156,920,000 in 2002 compared with $152,106,000 in 2001, but decreased 2% when compared with 2000’s total of $159,843,000. The $4,814,000 increase in net sales and operating revenues in 2002 compared with 2001 is primarily attributable to the segment selling a higher percentage of its limestone at a delivered price, including freight, partially offset by lower revenues due to the timing of the start of the shipping season on the Great Lakes, resulting in fewer sailing days in 2002 as compared to 2001.
The $2,923,000 decrease in net sales and operating revenue in 2002 compared with 2000 is primarily the result of more weather related delay days and lower overall demand from steel customers. The Company expects net sales and operating revenues to increase in 2003 due to the first quarter 2003 acquisition of Erie Sand and Gravel and continued execution of the Company’s Great Lakes Minerals strategy.
Cost of goods sold and operating expenses for the Great Lakes Minerals segment totaled $113,636,000 in 2002 compared with $113,230,000 in 2001 and $110,624,000 in 2000. As a percentage of net sales and operating revenues, cost of goods sold and operating expenses of 72% in 2002 decreased compared to 74% in 2001 and increased compared to 69% in 2000. The decrease in cost of goods sold and operating expenses as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues between 2002 and 2001 is primarily due to benefits derived from the pooling arrangement with American Steamship. The increase in cost of goods sold and operating expenses as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues between 2002 and 2000 is primarily the result of higher fuel costs and the expensing of higher winter maintenance costs in the mining operation. Because of the timing of the Michigan Limestone acquisition, no winter maintenance costs were incurred or expensed by the segment in 2000.
Operating income in 2002 increased to $18,858,000 compared to $15,421,000 in 2001 and decreased compared to $28,517,000 in 2000. The increase in operating income in 2002 compared with 2001 was primarily due to the decrease in cost of goods sold and operating expenses as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues discussed above. The decrease in operating income between 2002 and 2000 resulted from the increase in cost of goods sold and operating expenses as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues discussed above and an increase in the cost of providing retirement benefits.
Despite management’s expectation that limestone demand will be relatively flat, management is optimistic that the Great Lakes Minerals segment will see improvement in 2003 due to continued benefits and efficiencies from the pooling arrangement with American Steamship and the acquisition of Erie Sand and Gravel, which is expected to strengthen the Company’s leadership position on the Great Lakes.
Results of Operations-(Continued)
Global Stone
Net sales for the Global Stone segment increased by $5,991,000, or 4%, to $161,220,000 in 2002 compared with $155,229,000 during 2001. The segment’s 2002 net sales increased $17,264,000, or 12%, compared with 2000 sales of $143,956,000. Net sales increased in 2002 compared with 2001 primarily because of an increase in lawn and garden volume demand, the addition of new customers in the roofing and glass fillers industries being serviced by the segment’s James River and Global Stone Portage facilities and increased volume demand from steel customers out of the segment’s Chemstone and Winchester facilities, partially offset by decreased volume demand for carpet and flooring fillers and decreased lime sales in the Oklahoma regional market. The increase in net sales in 2002 compared to 2000 resulted from the trends identified above, increased freight included in net sales and the timing of the Global Stone Portage acquisition in September 2000. After adjusting for the timing of the Global Stone Portage acquisition and freight, 2000 sales were relatively flat compared to 2001 levels. Demand for fillers used in roofing shingles and glass and lawn and garden products were solid in 2002, while demand continued to weaken for fillers used in the carpet and flooring industry. Management expects these trends to continue over the next several quarters and believes sales for the segment will remain stable at 2002 levels during 2003.
Cost of goods sold for the Global Stone segment totaled $122,550,000 in 2002, an increase of 3% from $118,870,000 in 2001, and an increase of 17% from $105,109,000 in 2000. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was 76% in 2002, 77% in 2001 and 73% in 2000. The decrease in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily resulted from planned cost reductions and productivity enhancements at the plant level. The increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales in 2002 compared with 2000 was primarily attributable to increased fuel and energy costs. Management believes that continued cost control measures and productivity enhancements will improve the percentage of cost of goods sold to net sales in 2003.
Operating income for the Global Stone segment increased 39% to $15,603,000 during 2002 compared with $11,232,000 during 2001 and increased 1% compared with $15,484,000 during 2000. The increase in operating income in 2002 compared with 2001 is primarily attributable to the cessation of goodwill amortization in accordance with SFAS No. 142 ($1,799,000 in 2001), the increase in sales and decrease in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales discussed above, partially offset by an increase in the cost of providing retirement benefits. Additionally, the segment benefited in 2002 from the closure of its administrative office in Roswell, Georgia as part of the Company’s fourth quarter 2001 restructuring. Management expects that the Global Stone segment will improve its operating profitability in 2003 through continued cost control measures and productivity enhancements.
Performance Minerals
Net sales in 2002 for the Performance Minerals segment totaled $85,920,000 and decreased 14% compared to $99,389,000 in 2001 and 5% compared to $90,053,000 in 2000. The decrease in net sales for 2002 compared with 2001 primarily resulted from a decrease in volume demand for fracturing sand from the segment’s Brady, Texas facility, which is used to support drilling activity of oil field service firms, the closure of three non-strategic operating locations as part of the Company’s fourth quarter 2001 restructuring and decreased volume demand for building materials and golf course recreational sands. The decrease in net sales for 2002 compared to 2000 primar",1
"ITEM 7.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with “Item 8. Financial Statements and supplementary Data” contained herein.
OVERVIEW
We are an independent exploration and production company with operations in the deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico and offshore Angola and Gabon in West Africa. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, we have four discoveries: North Platte, Shenandoah, Anchor and Heidelberg. Heidelberg began initial production in January 2016, and North Platte, Shenandoah and Anchor are currently being appraised. In West Africa, we have made seven aggregate discoveries offshore Angola on Blocks 20 (Orca, Zalophus, Golfinho and Lontra) and 21 (Cameia, Bicuar and Mavinga). We also have a non-operated interest in the Diaba block offshore Gabon.
Angola Transaction
On August 22, 2015, we executed the Agreement with Sonangol for the sale by us to Sonangol of the entire issued and outstanding share capital of our indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, CIE Angola Block 20 Ltd. and CIE Angola Block 21 Ltd., which respectively hold our 40% working interest in each of Block 20 and Block 21 offshore Angola. The requisite Angolan government approvals were not received within one year from the execution date and the Agreement terminated by its terms in August 2016. Since then, we have been working with Sonangol to understand and agree on the financial and operational implications of the termination of the Agreement. As part of these discussions, we have requested that Sonangol extend certain deadlines for exploration and development milestones under the License Agreements. Under the Agreement, we are entitled to be put back in our original position as if no agreement had been concluded, which we believe requires Sonangol to extend all such deadlines by, at a minimum, the one year period the Agreement was pending plus the period of time from the termination of the Agreement until this matter is resolved.
No extensions have been granted to date. Over six months have passed since the termination of the Agreement and there can be no assurance that such extensions will be forthcoming on favorable terms or at all. The failure to receive such extensions would have a material adverse effect on the value of these License Agreements. See “Risk Factors-Risks Relating to Our Business-We may be unable to consummate the sale of our Angolan assets on favorable terms, or at all” and “Under the terms of our various license agreements, we are required to drill wells, declare any discoveries and conduct certain development activities in order to retain exploration and production rights. Failure to do so may result in substantial license renewal costs or loss of our interests in these license areas.”
We reserve the right to and will vigorously enforce the provisions of the Agreement and our rights under international law if Sonangol does not grant the extensions we believe we are entitled to under the Agreement. The dispute resolution procedures of the Agreement require that any dispute be finally resolved under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce, with proceedings seated in London, England. In addition, prior to commencing arbitration proceedings, a party must provide the other party with a Notice of Dispute describing the nature of the dispute and the relief requested. Given Sonangol’s delays and failure to date to grant the extensions, we submitted such a Notice of Dispute on March 8, 2017 to Sonangol under the Agreement. If Sonangol does not timely resolve this matter to our satisfaction, we intend to move forward with arbitration and at that time we will seek all available remedies at law or in equity. Further, our Angolan assets are indirectly held by a German subsidiary, and we therefore believe we are entitled to certain protections provided under international law under the bilateral investment treaty between Germany and Angola, dated October 30, 2003, including its substantive and procedural protections to investments of German investors.
In 2016, we recorded an impairment of $1,629.8 million related to our Angolan assets in accordance with ASC 932, which requires, among other things, that “sufficient progress” be made with respect to oil and natural gas projects in order to avoid the requirement to expense previously capitalized exploratory or appraisal well costs. Given Sonangol’s delays and failure to date to grant the extensions as well as the general investment climate in the Angolan oil and natural gas industry, the procedures of ASC 932 require us to record a full impairment of our Angolan assets at this time. It is important to note that this impairment represents previously capitalized exploratory
and appraisal well and other costs. The impairment is not associated with, nor is it indicative of, what we believe to be the intrinsic or fair market value of our Angolan assets. While we continue to market our Angola assets and believe they have substantial value to Cobalt, we believe the sale process has been negatively impacted by the uncertainty surrounding the extensions. We further believe that Sonangol's preference is for us to present potential buyers to them prior to finalizing the terms of the extensions.
Although we plan to continue to fulfill our obligations as operator, we do not plan to make any material additional investments in Angola until the financial and operational implications of the termination of the Agreement are resolved to our satisfaction. In addition, we are currently holding the $250 million initial payment that Sonangol made to us under the Agreement and do not plan to return any part of it until this matter, and the related matter of the joint interest receivable owed to us by Sonangol P&P under the RSA, is resolved.
Other Developments
In December 2016, we completed a debt exchange and financing transaction (the “Transaction”) with certain holders (the “Holders”) of our outstanding 2019 Notes and 2024 Notes. The Transaction consisted of (i) the issuance and sale of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of our new first lien senior secured notes due 2021 to the Holders for cash at a price of 98% and (ii) the issuance of $584.7 million aggregate principal amount of our new second lien senior secured notes due 2023 and 30.0 million shares of our common stock to the Holders in exchange for $616.6 million aggregate principal amount of our 2019 Notes and $95.9 million aggregate principal amount of our 2024 Notes held by the Holders. The Transaction raised approximately $490.0 million of additional liquidity but caused our annual interest payments to increase by approximately $79.9 million beginning in 2017. This was the first step in improving our financial condition while also better aligning our debt maturities with our likely development plans.
In January 2017, we consummated a follow-on debt exchange transaction with certain of the Holders whereby we issued an aggregate principal amount of $139.2 million in additional second lien senior secured notes due 2023 in exchange for $137.8 million aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes and $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes held by the Holders.
In September 2016, we entered into an amendment to our drilling contract in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico with Rowan and recorded a charge of $95.9 million, of which $76.3 million was paid in 2016. This amendment provides for the early termination of our long-term drilling contract for one of their drillships. The drilling contract was originally scheduled to terminate in February 2018, but the amendment provides for a contract termination date in March 2017. This amendment resulted in future savings to us of approximately $80.1 million.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon information reported in our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities. Certain of our accounting policies involve estimates and assumptions to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions or if different assumptions had been used. We base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other information and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable at the time, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty and, accordingly, these estimates may change as additional information is obtained, as more experience is acquired, as our operating environment changes and as new events occur.
We have defined a critical accounting policy as one that is both important to the portrayal of either our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult, subjective or complex assumptions or estimates about matters that are uncertain. There are other policies within our consolidated financial statements that require us
to make estimates and assumptions, but they are not deemed critical as defined above. We believe that the following are the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Oil and Natural Gas Properties
We account for our oil and natural gas properties using the successful efforts method of accounting. Under this method, costs of productive exploratory wells, development dry holes and productive wells and undeveloped leases are capitalized. Oil and natural gas lease acquisition costs are also capitalized. Exploration costs, including personnel costs, certain geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals for oil and natural gas leases, are charged to expense during the period the costs are incurred. Exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized, but charged to expense if and when the well is determined not to have found reserves in commercial quantities.
Under the successful efforts method of accounting, proved leasehold costs are capitalized and amortized over proved developed and undeveloped reserves on a units-of-production basis. Successful drilling costs, costs of development and developmental dry holes are capitalized and amortized over proved developed reserves on a units-of-production basis.
The application of the successful efforts method of accounting requires managerial judgment to determine the proper classification of wells designated as development or exploratory which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of the costs incurred. The results from a drilling operation can take considerable time to analyze and the determination that commercial reserves have been discovered requires both judgment and industry experience. Wells may be completed that are assumed to be productive and actually deliver oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids in quantities insufficient to be economic, which may result in the abandonment of the wells at a later date. Wells are drilled that have targeted geologic structures that are both developmental and exploratory in nature, and an allocation of costs is required to properly account for the results. Delineation seismic incurred to select development locations within an oil and natural gas field is typically considered a development cost and capitalized, but often these seismic programs extend beyond the reserve area considered proved and management must estimate the portion of the seismic costs to expense. The evaluation of oil and natural gas leasehold acquisition costs requires managerial judgment to estimate the fair value of these costs with reference to drilling activity in a given area. Drilling activities in an area by other companies may also effectively condemn leasehold positions.
The successful efforts method of accounting can have a significant impact on the operational results reported when we are entering a new exploratory area in hopes of finding an oil and natural gas field that will be the focus of future developmental drilling activity. The initial exploratory wells may be unsuccessful and will be expensed. Seismic costs can be substantial which will result in additional exploration expenses when incurred.
We assess our proved oil and natural gas properties for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the recorded carrying value of the properties may not be recoverable. Such events include a projection of future reserves that will be produced from a field, the timing of this future production, future costs to produce the oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids and future inflation levels. If the carrying amount of a property exceeds the sum of the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, we recognize an impairment expense equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the property, which is estimated to be the expected present value of the future net cash flows. Estimated future net cash flows are based on existing reserves, forecasted production and cost information and management’s outlook of future commodity prices. Where probable and possible reserves exist, an appropriately risk adjusted amount of these reserves is included in the impairment evaluation. The underlying commodity prices used in the determination of our estimated future net cash flows are based on NYMEX forward strip prices at the end of the period, adjusted by field or area for estimated location and quality differentials, as well as other trends and factors that management believes will impact realizable prices. Future operating costs estimates, including appropriate escalators, are also developed based on a review of actual costs by field or area. Downward revisions in estimates of reserve quantities or expectations of falling commodity prices or rising operating costs could result in a reduction in undiscounted future cash flows and could indicate a property impairment.
Estimates of Oil, Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids Reserves
Our estimates of proved reserves are based on the quantities of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible - from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations - prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimate. Reserves for proved developed producing wells were estimated using production performance and material balance methods. New producing properties with little production history were forecast using a combination of production performance and analogy to offset production, both of which provide accurate forecasts. Non-producing reserve estimates for both developed and undeveloped properties were forecast using either volumetric and/or analogy methods. These methods provide accurate forecasts due to the mature nature of the properties targeted for development and an abundance of subsurface control data.
The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data, engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. For example, we must estimate the amount and timing of future operating costs, development costs and workover costs, all of which may vary considerably from actual results. In addition, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves. Independent reserve engineers prepare our reserve estimates at the end of each year.
Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, our reserves are used throughout our financial statements. For example, since we use the units-of-production method to amortize the costs of our oil and natural gas properties, the quantity of reserves could significantly impact our depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. Our reserves are also the basis of our supplemental oil and natural gas disclosures.
Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations
We have significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and facilities at the end of oil and natural gas production operations. Our removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with dismantling facilities and plugging and abandoning wells. Estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal. Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, safety and public relations considerations.
We record an asset retirement obligation (“ARO”) and capitalize the asset retirement cost in oil and natural gas properties in the period in which the retirement obligation is incurred based upon the fair value of an obligation to dismantle facilities or plug and abandon wells. After recording these amounts, the ARO is accreted to its future estimated value using an assumed cost of funds and the additional capitalized costs are depreciated on a unit-of-production basis.
Inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation factors, credit adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments. To the extent future revisions of these assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset retirement obligation, a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and natural gas property balance.
Accounting for Embedded Derivatives
Our Secured Notes have derivatives related to the requirement to pay an applicable premium upon a change in control or an event of default embedded within the notes. In addition, our second lien senior secured notes also have a derivative related to a put option in an asset sale embedded within the notes. These embedded derivatives were accounted for as a liability at the inception of the obligations. We have elected not to apply hedge accounting to these embedded derivatives, and, accordingly, we carry these derivatives at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet, with the changes in the fair value included in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which
the change occurs. Our current results of operations would potentially have been significantly different had we elected and qualified for hedge accounting on these embedded derivatives.
We use the risk-neutral probability of default debt model to calculate the fair value of these embedded derivatives. Inherent in this model are various factors that include observable market prices for our Secured Notes and our Convertible Notes and the risk-free interest rates. The accuracy of the fair value calculation is a function of the quality of available data and judgment. Any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value of our embedded derivatives.
Revenue Recognition
Oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues are recognized when production is sold to a purchaser at fixed or determinable prices, when delivery has occurred and title has transferred and collectability of the revenue is reasonably assured. Virtually all of our contracts’ pricing provisions are tied to a market index, with certain adjustments based on, among other factors, whether a well delivers to a gathering or transmission line, quality of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids and prevailing supply and demand conditions, so that prices fluctuate to remain competitive with other available suppliers.
We follow the sales method of accounting for natural gas revenues. Under this method of accounting, revenues are recognized based on volumes sold, which may differ from the volume to which we are entitled based on our working interest. An imbalance is recognized as a liability only when the estimated remaining reserves will not be sufficient to enable the under-produced owner(s) to recoup its entitled share through future production. Under the sales method, no receivables are recorded where we have taken less than our share of production.
Income Taxes
We use the liability method to determine our income tax provisions, under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates. Under this method, the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. Valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining the need for valuation allowances, we have considered and made judgments and estimates regarding estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. These estimates and judgments include some degree of uncertainty and changes in these estimates and assumptions could require us to adjust the valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets depends on the generation of sufficient taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions.
We are subject to the jurisdiction of various domestic and foreign tax authorities. Our operations in these different jurisdictions are taxed on various bases and determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, or our level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact on the amount of income taxes that we provide during any given year.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2015
Net loss for 2016 was $2,343.3 million compared with $694.4 million for 2015. The significant factors in the change were (i) a $1,504.9 million increase in dry hole costs and impairments; (ii) a $95.9 million loss on the amendment of the Rowan contract; (iii) an $18.1 million increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization (“DD&A”); and (iv) an $17.2 million increase in general and administrative (“G&A”) expenses.
Oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues for 2016 totaled $16.8 million. These revenues are from the initial production of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids from the Heidelberg field in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico which came on line in January 2016.
Seismic and exploration costs for 2016 decreased $3.7 million compared with 2015 as a result of decreases of $14.1 million in seismic acquisition costs due to our efforts to control costs and $1.3 million in delay rentals offset by an increase of $11.7 million in other exploration costs primarily related to the write-off of costs of projects that had not yet been sanctioned.
In 2016, we incurred $1,967.2 million of dry hole costs and impairments. Of this amount, $1,629.8 million related to costs associated with our wells and underlying leases in Angola, $195.6 million related to costs associated with the Goodfellow #1 well and sidetrack and the underlying leases, $62.0 million related to the impairment of inventory and other property in Angola and $56.9 million related to costs associated with the Shenandoah #3 well as it is no longer reasonably possible that the wellbore could be used in the development of the project, should a final investment decision be reached. In 2015, we incurred $462.2 million of dry hole costs and impairments. Of this amount, $256.8 million related to the impairment of our Heidelberg field, $151.4 million related to costs association with our Lontra #1 exploratory well offshore Angola, $26.9 million related to impairments of our unproved leaseholds and $18.4 million related to costs associated with our North Platte #2 appraisal well in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.
In 2016, we announced that we entered into an amendment to our drilling contract with Rowan and recorded a charge of $95.9 million, of which $76.3 million was paid in 2016. This amendment provides for the early termination of our long-term drilling contract for one of their drillships. The drilling contract was originally scheduled to terminate in February 2018, but the amendment provides for a contract termination date in March 2017.
Lease operating expenses totaled $7.6 million, or $18.33 per BOE, in 2016. These lease operating expenses relate to fixed and variable costs of the Heidelberg field and associated transportation costs.
G&A expenses for 2016 increased $17.2 million compared with 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to (i) $19.6 million of fees associated with the Transaction; (ii) a $13.9 million reduction in amounts reimbursed from our partners due to lower activity levels in Angola; and (iii) a $8.1 million increase in legal fees related to our ongoing litigation offset by (iv) a $15.9 million decrease in payroll and equity-based compensation costs due to lower equity-based compensation costs from the reversal of costs related to forfeitures of unvested equity awards associated with our workforce reduction plan and (v) an $8.5 million overall decrease in other expenses due to lower activity levels in Angola and our cost cutting efforts.
DD&A for 2016 increased $18.1 million compared with 2015 due to the recording of depletion on our Heidelberg field. DD&A was $53.21 per BOE in 2016.
Interest expense for 2016 increased $19.7 million compared with 2015 due to $11.2 million of increased interest related to effects of the Transaction, $6.3 million of decreased interest capitalization as we are no longer capitalizing interest on our Angolan exploratory wells, and $2.2 million of net increased interest ($3.3 million of debt issuance costs written off offset by $1.1 million of decreased interest) associated with our borrowing base facility that was terminated in 2016.
Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2014
Net loss for 2015 was $694.4 million compared with $510.8 for 2014. The significant factors in the change were (i) a $225.3 million increase in dry hole costs and impairments; (ii) a $23.7 million decrease in seismic and exploration costs; and (iii) an $11.4 million decrease in interest expense.
Seismic and exploration costs for 2015 decreased $23.7 million compared with 2014. The decrease was primarily due to standby costs incurred in 2014 associated with two drilling rigs in West Africa.
In 2015, we incurred $462.2.0 million of dry hole costs and impairments. Of this amount, $256.8 million related to the impairment of our Heidelberg field, $151.4 million related to costs association with our Lontra #1 exploratory well offshore Angola, $26.9 million related to impairments of our unproved leaseholds, and $18.4 million related to costs associated with our North Platte #2 appraisal well in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. In 2014, we incurred dry hole costs and impairments of $236.9 million. Of this amount, $68.0 million related to impairments of our unproved leaseholds and $154.6 million related to costs associated with our Anchor #1 and Yucatan #2 exploratory wells in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and our Loengo #1 and Mupa #1 exploratory wells offshore Angola.
G&A expenses for 2015 decreased $4.2 million compared with 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $10.8 million overall decrease in other expenses due to lower activity levels in Angola offset by a $3.5 million increase in payroll and equity-based compensation related to a higher bonus accrual and a $3.1 million increase in legal fees related to our ongoing litigation.
Interest expense for 2015 decreased $11.4 million compared with 2014 due to increased interest capitalization of $47.4 million offset by a $16.8 million increase in interest expense related to the 3.125% convertible senior notes due 2024 that were issued in May 2014 and a $19.1 million increase in amortization of debt issuance costs and accretion of discount.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $956.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments. This amount (i) includes the $250.0 million paid to us by Sonangol pursuant to the Agreement that we intend to retain, along with other payments due to Sonangol, until the matters with respect to the extensions are resolved, and (ii) excludes the $159.1 million receivable owed to us by Sonangol. For more information, please see “Item 1 - Business - West Africa - Angola Transaction.”
In 2017, we currently expect to spend approximately $275.0 million for our development activities, and expect that our outlays will significantly decrease after the first quarter of 2017 as we complete our drilling activities at our North Platte, Shenandoah and Anchor discoveries. Total 2017 cash outlays are currently expected to be between $550 million and $650 million.
Although we commenced initial production from our Heidelberg project in January 2016, our ongoing capital and operating expenditures will vastly exceed the revenue we expect to receive from our oil and natural gas operations for the foreseeable future. We expect to incur substantial expenditures and generate significant operating losses as we:
•
progress our discoveries toward project sanction; all of which are subject to, or will soon be subject to, the requirement that we conduct continuous operations on such leases or until such time as we are granted an SOP;
•
continue development drilling activities on the Heidelberg field with the aim to increase its oil and natural gas production over time;
•
selectively conduct exploration drilling on our current acreage;
•
incur increased interest expense; and
•
incur expenses related to operating as a public company and compliance with regulatory requirements.
These activities will require that we raise substantial additional funding. If we are unable to raise substantial additional funding on a timely basis or on acceptable terms, we may be required to significantly curtail our exploration, appraisal and development activities.
We adopted ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern, on December 31, 2016. This ASU required us to evaluate and disclose whether there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our assessment included the preparation of a detailed cash forecast that included all projected cash inflows and outflows as well as consideration of any cash related covenants associated with our financing structure.
In December 2016, we entered into the Transaction as a part of obtaining new capital. The indentures governing our Secured Notes contain certain covenants including the maintenance of a minimum consolidated cash balance of at least $200.0 million. As our detailed cash forecast shows that our projected cash balances would be out of compliance with the minimum consolidated cash balance covenant within one year after the date this consolidated financial statements are issued, we have concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
Our ability to continue as a going concern is subject to, among other factors, our ability to monetize assets, our ability to obtain financing or refinance existing indebtedness, our ability to continue our cost cutting efforts for long-term rig and support services, the produ",1

When used in this Annual Report, the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” and similar expressions, as they relate to the Company or the management of the Company, identify forward-looking statements. Such statements reflect the current views of the Company with respect to future events, the outcome of which is subject to certain risks, including among others; general economic and market conditions, decreased consumer demand for the Company’s products, possible disruptions in the Company’s computer or telephone systems, possible work stoppages, or increases in labor costs, effects of competition, possible disruptions or delays in the opening of new stores or inability to obtain suitable sites for new stores, higher than anticipated store closings or relocation costs, higher interest rates, unanticipated increases in merchandise or occupancy costs and other factors which may be outside the Company’s control, including the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results or outcomes may vary materially from those described herein as anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended or planned. Subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to the Company or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements in this paragraph and described elsewhere in this Annual Report and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The Company does not assume the obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Shareholders should carefully evaluate such statements in light of factors, including risk factors, described in the Company’s filings with the SEC, especially on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K. In Item 1A., “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company discusses in more detail various important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historic results. The Company notes these factors for readers as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Shareholders should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, shareholders should not consider any such list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies, many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in the financial statements and related notes. Since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty, the actual results will inevitably differ from the Company’s estimates. Such differences could be material to the financial statements.
The Company believes that its application of accounting policies, and the estimates inherently required by the policies, are reasonable. These accounting policies and estimates are constantly reevaluated, and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change. Historically, the Company has found the application of accounting policies to be appropriate, and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates.
The Company’s accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements presented elsewhere in this Annual Report. The Company has identified certain critical accounting policies that are described below.
Merchandise Inventory - Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis, as determined by the retail inventory method. Under the retail method, inventory cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio between the costs of goods available for sale and the retail value of inventories. For a brief period, from October 4, 2009 through October 2, 2010, the Syms stores utilized a different method, the moving weighted average cost method. Under the moving weighted average cost method, inventory cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying an average cost based on the cost of goods available for sale divided by the number of units available for sale. After we completed the acquisition of Filene’s, the Company found itself in the position that a portion of its business was utilizing the moving average cost method and a portion of its business was utilizing the retail inventory method. The Company thus was faced with the choice of either converting Filene’s to the moving average cost method or transitioning the Syms stores back to the system that they had previously utilized. The Company determined that it would be more effective to revert back to the retail inventory method. The change in the method of recording Syms inventory in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 and the third quarter of fiscal 2010 did not have a material impact on reported results of operations. The significant estimates used are for markdowns and shrinkage.
Factors considered in the determination of permanent markdowns include current and anticipated demand, customer preferences and age of the merchandise, fashion trends and weather conditions. In addition, inventory is also evaluated against corporate pre-determined historical markdown trends. When a decision is made to permanently markdown merchandise, the resulting gross margin reduction is recognized in the period the markdown is recorded. The timing of the decision, particularly surrounding the balance sheet date, can have a significant effect on the results of operations.
Shrinkage is estimated as a percentage of sales for the period from the date of the last physical inventory to the end of the fiscal year. Physical inventories are taken at least annually for all stores and inventory records are adjusted accordingly. The shrinkage rate from the most recent physical inventory, in combination with historical experience, is used as the standard for the shrinkage accrual following the physical inventory.
The Company has found the use of these estimates to be appropriate and actual results have not differed materially. However, the Company is subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause its future estimates to differ materially from past experience.
Long-Lived Assets -In evaluating and measuring an impairment loss, we consider individual retail locations to be the appropriate asset group, since the store level is the lowest level at which identifiable cash flows are independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. We evaluate long lived assets for impairment at all of our retail locations on at least an annual basis at the end of each fiscal year, after the holiday selling season, when we have the most visibility into the operations of the individual store. We will also test an asset group for impairment during the year if any impairment indicators are identified that could result in a potential impairment. If it is determined that such indicators are present and the review discloses that the assets will not be fully recoverable, based on undiscounted estimated cash flows over the remaining useful lives, their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair value. Various factors, including future sales growth and profit margins, are included in this analysis. To the extent these future projections or the Company’s strategies change, the conclusion regarding impairment may differ from the Company’s current estimates.
Deferred Tax Valuation Allowance - The Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that could produce additional future taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. Should the Company determine that it will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will be charged to income in the period such determination is made.
Results of Operations
The following discussion compares the fiscal years ended February 26, 2011, February 27, 2010 and February 28, 2009. All of the fiscal years were comprised of 52 weeks.
Fiscal Year Ended February 26, 2011 (Fiscal 2010) Compared to Fiscal Year Ended February 27, 2010 (Fiscal 2009)
Net sales increased by $67.8 million or 18% to $445.1 million during fiscal 2010 from $377.3 million in fiscal 2009. This increase was primarily the result of having a full 12 months of sales in Fiscal 2010 from the Filene’s stores which were acquired in fiscal 2009. Net sales in fiscal 2009 included sales from Filene’s from June 19, 2009 (first day of operating ownership). Comparable store sales, including Filene’s sales for comparable periods, were flat in fiscal 2010. Comparable store sales in the prior year, excluding Filene’s sales, decreased 15%. The Company’s comparable store sales computation only includes stores that have been owned and operated by the Company for a period of at least twelve full fiscal months. In addition, the Company opened one store during fiscal 2010 which contributed $1.9 million of the sales increase. Partially offsetting the above sales increases was the loss of $24.7 million of sales in fiscal 2010 resulting from the closing of four stores during fiscal 2010 and five stores during fiscal 2009.
By merchandise category, our Women’s business grew to 46% of total company net sales from 44% in the prior year, Domestics grew to 6% from 5% last year and Shoes grew to 5% from 4% in fiscal 2009. This was primarily the result of having a full 12 months of sales in fiscal 2010 from the Filene’s stores which were acquired in fiscal 2009. These increases came at the expense of Men’s which decreased 4%, from 42% of total Company net sales in fiscal 2009 to 38% this year. Children’s apparel did not change, remaining at 5% of total company net sales. Comparable store sales for the stores in the New York metropolitan area were negative low single digits. Offsetting this were the stores in the South that had flat comparable store sales and stores in other areas of the country that had comparable store sales increase in the low single digits.
Gross profit increased by $28.7 million to $173.8 million during fiscal 2010 from $145.1 million during fiscal 2009. This increase was primarily the result of having a full 12 months of sales in fiscal 2010 from the Filene’s stores which were acquired in fiscal 2009. Gross profit as a percent of net sales increased 50 basis points to 39.0% during fiscal 2010 from 38.5% during the comparable prior year period. This increase was primarily due to the Company taking fewer markdowns this year as a result of it being less promotional. Partially offsetting the lower markdowns, the Company increased its reserve for inventory obsolescence by $6.2 million, as it determined that it had not adequately cleared out old season merchandise as of year-end. In addition, the Company’s leased department income increased during fiscal 2010. Partially offsetting these increases were a lower markup, as the Company continued to reduce prices in order to maintain competitiveness with other retailers.
The Company’s gross profit excludes the cost of its distribution network. For the fiscal years ended February 26, 2011 and February 27, 2010, the amounts incurred for our distribution network that were classified in selling, general and administrative expenses and occupancy costs were $19.0 million and $15.6 million, respectively.
Selling, general and administrative expense (“SG&A”) increased $14.9 million to $124.4 million during fiscal 2010 as compared to $109.5 million during fiscal 2009. This increase was primarily the result of having a full 12 months of expenses in fiscal 2010 from the Filene’s stores, which were acquired in fiscal 2009. As a percent of net sales, SG&A decreased approximately 110 basis points to 27.9% of net sales during fiscal 2010 from 29.0% of net sales in the comparable prior year period. SG&A as a percent of net sales decreased primarily as a result of lower payroll expenses as a percent of net sales during fiscal 2010. In addition, the prior year period included life insurance premiums on the policy covering the Company’s founder prior to his death in November 2009.
Advertising expense for fiscal 2010 was $7.0 million or 1.6% of net sales as compared to $8.2 million or 2.2% of net sales for fiscal 2009. Advertising expense for fiscal 2010 decreased primarily due to the Company being less promotional this year, a reallocation of advertising efforts to less expensive social media from more traditional media and the fact that the Company incurred expenses celebrating Filene’s 100th anniversary and Syms’ 50th anniversary in fiscal 2009.
Occupancy costs, net, were $64.2 million or 14.4% of net sales for fiscal 2010 as compared to $49.5 million or 13.1% of net sales for fiscal 2009. This increase was primarily the result of having a full 12 months of occupancy costs in fiscal 2010 from the Filene’s stores which were acquired in fiscal 2009. Partially offsetting this increase was the closing of four stores during fiscal 2010 and five stores during fiscal 2009. The Company reduces its net occupancy costs by the amount of rental income from third parties on real estate holdings incidental to the Company’s retail operations. That factor did not materially impact comparative results during fiscal 2010. For fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, rental income was $2.3 million and $2.4 million, respectively.
Depreciation and amortization expense was $14.6 million or 3.3% of net sales for fiscal 2010 as compared to $11.4 million or 3.0% of net sales for fiscal 2009. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily a result of the Filene’s acquisition and capital expenditure additions during the past two fiscal years.
Asset impairment charge for fiscal 2010 was $4.3 million or 1.0% of net sales as compared to $0.1 million or 0.0% of net sales for fiscal 2009. During fiscal 2010, the Company determined that six stores’ long-lived assets had been impaired. In addition, the Company shifted most of its merchandise processing from its New Jersey distribution center to its Massachusetts distribution center, in order to reduce distribution costs. This shift resulted in a partial impairment of the New Jersey facility. In conjunction with this move, an office in Massachusetts was closed giving rise to a further impairment charge. During fiscal 2009, one store’s long-lived assets had been determined to be impaired.
In conjunction with the acquisition of Filene’s in June 2009, the Company determined that the fair values of assets acquired exceeded the purchase price by approximately $9.7 million, resulting in a bargain purchase gain in fiscal 2009, based upon valuations of inventory, fixed assets, equipment and intangible assets net of deferred taxes, customer obligations and other adjustments. Acquisition costs of $4.9 million, including investment banking, legal, professional and other costs, were expensed in fiscal 2009.
Other income was $0 for fiscal 2010 as compared to $25.0 million for fiscal 2009. Last year’s income resulted from a gain on life insurance proceeds from officers’ life insurance policies on the Company’s founder, who passed away during fiscal 2009.
Loss on disposition of assets for fiscal 2010 was $0.5 million or 0.1% of net sales as compared to $1.2 million or 0.3% of net sales for fiscal 2009. During fiscal 2010 the loss on disposition of assets was the net result of closing four stores, selling three stores and downsizing one store. The related charge in fiscal 2009 was related to the closure of five stores.
The Company recorded $9.3 million of restructuring charges during fiscal 2010 and had no such charges in fiscal 2009. The Company opened one store and closed four stores during fiscal 2010. The Company is required to continue to make lease payments on two of these closed stores, one through May 2012 and the other through September 2017. The Company has recorded the present value of these payments as a restructuring charge, totaling approximately $7.2 million. In addition, as part of the integration of the Syms and Filene’s operations, a total of $2.1 million of IT related professional fees, legal fees and severance costs associated with staffing level reductions were incurred and have been recorded as restructuring charges.
Interest expense was $1.4 million or 0.3% of net sales during fiscal 2010 compared to $1.5 million or 0.4% of net sales during fiscal 2009. For fiscal 2010, interest expense was a result of borrowings on the Company’s revolving credit facility. During the prior year period, interest expense was due to borrowings against the cash surrender value of officers’ life insurance policies and borrowings on the Company’s revolving credit facility.
The sales and gross profit increase attributable to the acquisition of Filene’s were insufficient to offset the expense increases and impairment and restructuring charges incurred during fiscal 2010. As a result of the above-noted items, the loss before income taxes for fiscal 2010 was $51.7 million as compared to a loss of $6.4 million for fiscal 2009.
For fiscal 2010, the effective income tax rate was 36.5% as compared to 230.2% for fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2010, the difference between the effective income tax rate and the federal statutory rate resulted primarily from state income taxes, adjustments related to prior year income taxes, and to a lesser extent permanent differences in the deductibility of expenses for book and tax. In fiscal 2009, this difference related mostly to the non-taxable nature of the life insurance proceeds received and recorded in income, partially offset by the effect of adjustments related to prior year taxes. The change in the effective income tax rate is primarily due to the above noted items occurring in one year and not the other.
Fiscal Year Ended February 27, 2010 (Fiscal 2009) Compared to Fiscal Year Ended February 28, 2009 (Fiscal 2008)
Net sales for fiscal 2009 were $377.3 million, an increase of $135.3 million or 56% as compared to net sales of $242.0 million for fiscal 2008. Net sales for fiscal 2009 included sales from Filene’s from June 19, 2009 (first date of operating ownership). Comparable store sales, which are for Syms stores only, decreased 15% or approximately $32.4 million, reflective of the continued economic recession in the U.S. which resulted in lower retail sales across most markets. In our comparable store computation, we only include stores that have been opened for a period of at least 12 months and stores that were open during both fiscal years. Syms closed a store in Virginia and opened a new store in close proximity to the previous location. This location is included in the comparable store comparisons. We opened no new locations in fiscal 2009 and there was no expansion in square footage in existing stores. Partially offsetting the above sales increase was the loss of $9.8 million of sales resulting from the closing of five stores during fiscal 2009.
Gross profit for fiscal 2009 was $145.1 million or 38.5% of net sales compared with $100.5 million or 41.5% of net sales for the prior year, an increase of $44.6 million or 44%. Gross profit for fiscal 2009 included gross profit from Filene’s from June 19, 2009 (first date of operating ownership). Gross profit for Syms, exclusive of Filene’s, decreased by $24.4 million which is attributable to decreased sales from declines in store traffic commensurate with the recessionary trend in the U.S. economy and a reduction in gross profit percentage from 41.5% to 38.1%. This decline in gross profit percentage is attributable to reduced margin on close-out sales at five stores that were closed in fiscal 2009, reduced margin on selected merchandise at two stores in preparation for co-branding of Syms and Filene’s merchandise in the same location, and overall margin decline across all stores due to a re-pricing strategy to reduce prices to 2001 retail levels.
The Company’s gross profit excludes the cost of its distribution network. For the fiscal years ended February 27, 2010 and February 28, 2009, the amounts incurred for our distribution network that were classified in selling, general and administrative expenses and occupancy costs were $15.6 million and $7.9 million, respectively.
Selling, general and administrative expense (“SG&A”) increased $35.6 million to $109.5 million or 29.0% of net sales for fiscal 2009 as compared to $73.9 million or 30.6% of net sales for fiscal 2008. SG&A for fiscal 2009 included SG&A from Filene’s from June 19, 2009 (first date of operating ownership). SG&A for Syms, exclusive of Filene’s, decreased, predominately as a result of reductions in personnel and other controllable expenses commensurate with the reduction in sales previously discussed.
Advertising expense for fiscal 2009 was $8.2 million or 2.2% of net sales compared with $6.3 million or 2.6% of net sales for the prior year, an increase of $1.9 million. Advertising expense for fiscal 2009 included advertising expense from Filene’s from June 19, 2009 (first date of operating ownership). For fiscal 2009 vs. fiscal 2008, advertising expense for Syms, exclusive of Filene’s, decreased, primarily due to shifts away from TV advertising to a lower-cost and more geographically focused usage of radio, e-mail and in-store promotional activities.
Occupancy costs for fiscal 2009 were $49.5 million or 13.1% of net sales compared with $16.3 million or 6.7% of net sales for the prior year, an increase of $33.2 million. Occupancy costs for fiscal 2009 included occupancy costs from Filene’s from June 19, 2009 (first date of operating ownership). Occupancy costs for Syms, exclusive of Filene’s, decreased, primarily as a result of the closure of five store locations. In addition, increased occupancy in certain rental properties resulted in the Company offsetting occupancy costs with net rental income of $2.4 million in fiscal 2009 compared to $2.0 million in fiscal 2008.
Depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal 2009 was $11.4 million or 3.0% of net sales compared with $8.0 million or 3.3% of net sales for the prior year, an increase of $3.4 million. Depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal 2009 included depreciation and amortization expense from Filene’s from June 19, 2009 (first date of operating ownership). For fiscal 2009, depreciation and amortization expense for Syms, exclusive of Filene’s, decrease primarily to assets reaching fully depreciated status.
In conjunction with the acquisition of Filene’s, the Company determined that the fair values of assets acquired exceeded the purchase price by approximately $9.7 million, resulting in a bargain purchase gain in fiscal 2009 based upon valuations of inventory, fixed assets, equipment and intangible assets, net of deferred taxes, customer obligations and other adjustments. Acquisition costs inclusive of investment banking, legal, professional and other costs aggregating $4.9 million were expensed in the periods incurred.
During fiscal 2009, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $0.1 million related to estimated impairments in the carrying value of one retail location and a loss of $1.2 million from the disposition of assets related to the closure of five store locations. During fiscal 2008, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $0.5 million and a gain from the sale of assets of $0.5 million.
Other income was $25.0 million for fiscal 2009 as compared to $0.1 million for fiscal 2008. This increase is due to the receipt of life insurance proceeds from officers’ life insurance policies on the life of the Company’s founder (Sy Syms), who died in November, 2009.
Interest expense was $1.5 million for fiscal 2009 as compared to $0.0 million for fiscal 2008. This increase is due to interest incurred on a cash surrender value advance and interest incurred on borrowings under a revolving credit facility with Bank of America and an unused credit line with IDB.
The loss before income taxes for fiscal 2009 was $6.4 million compared with a loss before income taxes of $4.0 million for fiscal 2008. The decrease in operating results before income taxes resulted from the factors discussed above.
For fiscal 2009, the effective income tax rate was 230.2% as compared to 15.1% for fiscal 2008. The increase in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 reflects the impact of permanent differences of certain income items not taxable.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Working capital at February 26, 2011 was $31.6 million, a decrease of $21.2 million from February 27, 2010, and the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 1.46 to 1 as compared to 1.84 to 1 at February 27, 2010. The decrease in working capital was primarily due to a reduction in assets held for sale, as three of the four properties held, were sold during fiscal 2010. In addition, accrued expenses increased as a result of the restructuring charges related to lease payments for two stores closed during fiscal 2010.
Net cash used by operating activities totaled $15.6 million for fiscal 2010 as compared to net cash provided of $26.9 million for fiscal 2009. The net cash used in fiscal 2010 reflects the net loss reported in fiscal 2010. The net cash provided in 2009 reflects the receipt of life insurance proceeds from officers’ life insurance policies on the Company’s founder, who died during fiscal 2009.
Net cash used in investing activities was $4.8 million for fiscal 2010 as compared to net cash used of $51.1 million for fiscal 2009. The acquisition of the assets of Filene’s in fiscal 2009 largely accounts for the higher cash usage in fiscal 2009.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $20.6 million for fiscal 2010 as compared to $24.4 million for fiscal 2009. For fiscal 2010, this reflects borrowing under the Company’s revolving credit facility to cover operating expenses. For fiscal 2009, this reflects an advance of $16.0 million of cash value of officers’ life insurance and proceeds from credit borrowings of $8.4 million to cover operating expenses.
The Company had an unsecured $40 million, revolving credit facility with Israel Discount Bank (“IDB”) through June 4, 2009, the agreement for which contained various financial covenants and ratio requirements. There were no borrowings under this facility during its term and the Company was in compliance with its covenants during the period in which this facility was available. Effective June 5, 2009, the Company revised this facility to a secured $40 million, revolving credit facility with the same bank and in connection with the acquisition of Filene’s, borrowed $24.0 million under this facility.
On August 27, 2009, the Company entered into a secured $75 million revolving Credit Agreement which replaced the IDB facility, and expires on August 27, 2012. That Credit Agreement, which has been amended as of January 7, 2011 and March 8, 2011, is among Syms Corp, as Lead Borrower, the other Borrowers named therein, the guarantors named therein, the lenders party thereto and Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent. Availability thereunder is based on a borrowing base consisting generally of certain inventory, credit card receivables, mortgaged real estate and cash collateral (the “Borrowing Base”). In connection with the Bank of America facility, the Company recognized approximately $1.1 million of deferred financing costs, which are being amortized over the term of the agreement. This facility bears interest at various rates depending on availability under formula. As of February 26, 2011, the interest rate on the facility was Prime +2.25% or LIBOR +3.25%, which equates to 5.50% and 3.51%, respectively. In addition, Syms Corp and the other Borrower (collectively, the “Borrowers”) are subject to certain negative covenants customary for credit facilities of this size, type and purpose. These covenants restrict or limit, among other things, their ability to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens on their assets, dispose of assets, make acquisitions and investments, merge, dissolve or consolidate and pay dividends, redeem equity and make other restricted payments.
The Credit Agreement sets forth financial conditions which must be fulfilled in order for a Borrower (i) to (a) acquire a controlling interest in another entity, all or substantially all of the assets of another entity or a business unit of another entity; (b) enter into a merger or consolidation having the same effect; or (c) acquire additional store locations from another entity; (ii) to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire equity interests issued by it or (iii) to make a voluntary prepayment, repurchase, redemption or defeasance of indebtedness permitted by the Credit Agreement (other than indebtedness subordinated to the indebtedness under the Credit Agreement). These conditions require that:
(i)
No default exists under the Credit Agreement;
(ii)
After giving effect to the contemplated transaction, Average Daily Availability for each month during the 12 months following such transaction be at least equal to 30% of the Loan Cap; and
(iii)
The consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, after giving pro forma effect to such transaction for the 12 months prior to such transaction be at least 1.2:1.0.
“Average Daily Availability” is computed for each month as follows: (a) for each day during such month the excess of the Loan Cap at the close of business over the outstanding principal amount of the loans and letter of credit obligations at the close of business is determined, (b) the sum of the figures resulting from the computations in clause (a) is determined and (c) such sum is divided by the number of days in such month. The “Loan Cap” for each day is an amount equal to the lesser of $75 million and the Borrowing Base (as described above) for such day, plus, in each case, the outstanding principal amount of the term loan for such day. Determination of whether the second or third condition described above is satisfied requires the Company to give effect to the contemplated transaction. Thus, unless and until a specific transaction is proposed, no calculation is required or can be made with respect to these conditions. No transactions giving rise to this calculation occurred during the fiscal year ended February 26, 2011.
In addition, the restriction on indebtedness provides for an availability of up to $5 million at any time outstanding for indebtedness incurred to acquire fixed or capital assets, as well as customary carve-outs for existing debt, intercompany debt, guaranties in favor of suppliers and the like. As of February 26, 2011, the Borrowers have no such indebtedness outstanding.
The Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant which requires that the Borrowers maintain at all times unutilized borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement in an amount of not less than 12.5% of the Borrowing Base described above (or $9.375 million, whichever is less). As of February 26, 2011, the Borrowing Base was $60.9 million, which means that the Company was required to maintain unutilized borrowing capacity of not less than $7.6 million.
As of February 26, 2011, $30.2 million is outstanding under the Credit Agreement. Each of the Company’s loan facilities has had sub-limits for letters of credit which when utilized, reduce availability under the facility. At February 26, 2011 and February 27, 2010, the Company had outstanding letters of credit of $10.1 million and $6.6 million, respectively. Total interest charges incurred for",1
"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Report.
General
The Company’s principal business is delivering news and informational content by various media including publishing newspapers both in print and online in the United States of America, and its publications are primarily daily and non-daily newspapers and Web sites.
As of December 30, 2007, the Company owned and operated 22 daily newspapers and 321 non-daily publications strategically clustered in six regions: Greater Philadelphia; Michigan; Connecticut; the Greater Cleveland area of Ohio; and the Capital-Saratoga and Mid-Hudson regions of New York and owns JobsInTheUS (‘‘JIUS’’), a network of 20 employment Web sites. The Company has total paid daily circulation of approximately 513,000, total paid Sunday circulation of approximately 530,000 and total non-daily distribution of approximately 5.5 million.
The Company’s revenues are derived from advertising, paid circulation, including single copy sales and subscription sales, and commercial printing and other activities. The Company’s newspapers and Web sites seek to produce desirable results for local advertisers by targeting readers based on certain geographic and demographic characteristics. The Company seeks to increase readership, and thereby generate traffic for its advertisers, by focusing on high product quality, compelling and primarily proprietary local content and creative and interactive promotions. The Company also publishes numerous special sections, as well as niche and special interest publications. Such publications tend to increase readership within targeted demographic groups and geographic areas. The Company’s management believes that as a result of these strategies, its newspapers in conjunction with its Web sites represent an attractive and cost-effective medium for its readers and advertisers.
The Company promotes single copy sales of its newspapers because it believes that such sales have even higher readership than subscription sales, and that single copy readers tend to be more active consumers of goods and services. Single copy sales also tend to generate higher profit margins than subscription sales, as single copy sales generally have higher per unit prices and lower distribution costs. Subscription sales, which provide readers with the convenience of home delivery, are an important component of the Company’s circulation base.
The Company’s advertising revenues are derived primarily from a broad group of local advertisers. No single advertiser accounted for more than one percent of the Company’s total fiscal year 2007 revenues. The Company’s advertising revenues are susceptible to economic swings, particularly those that affect the regional economies in the markets in which the Company operates, and can be difficult to predict.
In addition, the Company is committed to expanding its business through its Internet initiatives. The Company’s digital/online objective is to make its Web sites, all of which are accessible through www.JournalRegister.com, the local information portal for their respective markets by establishing such Web sites as the indispensable source of useful and reliable community news, sports, information and advertising in their markets. As of December 30, 2007, the Company operated 228 Web sites, which are affiliated with the Company’s daily newspapers and non-daily publications and its JobsInTheUS network.
Trends and Future Outlook
In recent years, the newspaper industry has experienced very challenging times with eroding advertising revenue due to competing sources of news and information from broadcast, cable, blogs, pod-casts and other forms of digital and print media. Negative factors in the overall general United States economy are also contributing to revenue declines. The Company has not been immune to this trend and has suffered declines in revenue on par with the rest of the industry. The Michigan cluster of the Company has been especially hard hit, not only with industry trend difficulties, but with regional economic problems brought on by the weakness in the domestic auto industry.
The Company believes, like many in the industry, that print advertising will continue to decline over the long-term. However, the Company also believes that its mission of providing hyper-local news, business, sports and lifestyle coverage content is unique and valuable. The principal challenge remains to develop competitive digital revenue streams that will replace lost print advertising. This will require the continued investment in digital technology and people. The challenging environment requires the Company to become more effective and efficient in reacting to the daily changes that are happening within its markets.
Recently, the Company has made major changes in its executive management, the vision of the Company and its evolving business model. Management has set out the following priorities to address the above challenges:
• Improve the Company’s revenues in the short-term - The number one priority for the Company is to reverse the decline in revenue. In order to accomplish this, the Company has made several changes in its management group, changed its incentive compensation programs, hired new sales personnel, improved its sales training, launched new print advertising products, encouraged its sales force to meet face-to-face with their customers, invested in online technologies and initiated new online partnerships.
• Become entrepreneur-driven - In order to allow each property to address their local issues, its publishers are expected to run their properties in a more entrepreneurial manner taking measured risks to create value and to grow the enterprise that each manage. This is a significant cultural change, with the Company’s executive management acting as facilitators of change as opposed to being the source of change. This will allow the publishers to make the key decisions that are needed to meet the challenges facing them as entrepreneurs in their local markets.
• Attract and retain key employees - The Company believes that its employee base must be retained and gaps in the talent spectrum must be filled with competent, energetic candidates in order to meet the current challenges of the business.
• Debt reduction - The Company continues to look for new ways to improve cash flows and reduce debt. The Company continues to explore different ways to accomplish this objective, such as: sales of redundant and unused or under-used assets; sale-leaseback opportunities; the identification and remediation of unprofitable products; and reductions in its cost base.
• Continued investment in online business - It is through continued investment in digital advertising and content delivery that the Company seeks to transition to a hyper local multi-media company and improve its revenues.
• Michigan properties remain important to the Company - The Company’s investment in Michigan has not performed as was expected at the time of acquisition, largely because of a weak local economy that developed after the acquisition. These operations remain an important part of the business. The Company believes that the Michigan economy will enjoy better days; although, the Company does not expect things to improve until sometime in late 2008, at best. The Company has made significant investments in Michigan including its new press and facility that went into service in the third quarter of 2007, and accomplished cost reductions through its cluster strategy and elimination of redundancies within the cluster. The Company has completed negotiations on its union contracts. These contracts will allow the Company to operate more effectively and efficiently in its major Michigan markets.
• Cost reductions - The Company reduced operating expenses and will continue to keep this at the forefront of its initiatives. Through reductions of non-essential expenses, the consolidation of operations and services and elimination of redundant costs, the Company expects to partially mitigate the impact of the ongoing difficult revenue environment. At the same time, the Company is cognizant that expenses cannot be cut too deeply thereby destroying the quality of its products and, as result, customer loyalty. Therefore, the Company will continue to invest in quality people and product improvements to protect the Company’s value.
The Company expects the transformation from a newspaper company largely focused on print, to one with a balanced focus on both print and new media platforms to provide opportunities for its
entrepreneurial publishers to grow their respective businesses. Ultimately, the goal is to be a leading entrepreneur-driven multi-media company in its local markets. The Company expects advertising revenues to continue to shift from print to online as customers expectations evolve. It is expected the priorities above will carry the Company through a challenging transition period over the next several quarters. 2008 will require constant innovation, reinvention and fortitude to overcome the challenges facing the Company in this changing and evolving industry.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
General
The Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of its financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, investments, remaining useful lives of long-lived assets, income taxes, self-insurance, pensions and other post-retirement benefits, as well as contingencies and litigation. Additionally, in the course of its annual goodwill impairment test, the Company makes estimates about future growth, cost containment, capital expenditures and many other factors which affect the results of this assessment. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience, actuarial studies and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable and applicable under the circumstances. The Company reevaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due to the Company from normal business activities. The allowance for doubtful accounts represents provisions for the estimated loss from the inability of customers to make required payments. The Company uses historical experience as well as current market information in determining the estimate. The Company writes off accounts receivable, which are deemed uncollectible, on a specific identification basis. If the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Intangible assets recorded in connection with the acquisition of publications or businesses generally consist of the values assigned to subscriber and advertiser relationships, mastheads, no-competition covenants and the excess of the cost over the fair value of identifiable net assets of the publications or businesses acquired (more commonly referred to as goodwill).
Intangible assets, excluding goodwill and mastheads, are being amortized using the straight-line method over a period of their estimated useful life (generally 3 to 15 years). These assets are tested for impairment only when the Company has determined that potential impairment indicators are present. If these indicators are present, the Company determines if the estimated undiscounted cash flows generated by the primary long-lived asset group generates sufficient cash flows to recover the carrying value of the primary asset group including identifiable intangible assets. If not, an impairment loss would be recognized to the extent the discounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset group.
Goodwill and mastheads are not amortized but are tested for impairment either annually or more frequently, if required. For purposes of accounting for the Company’s indefinite lived intangibles, the Company has established reporting units at a level below the operating segment level. These reporting units consist principally of the aggregated newspaper print and online operations within the five regional
clusters and the JobsInTheUS business. The impairment test determines the fair value of the reporting units primarily based on the estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by the reporting units. A goodwill impairment loss is recognized when the estimated discounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the reporting unit. Similarly, an impairment loss is recognized when the estimated fair value of mastheads is less than the carrying value of the mastheads. These approaches, along with the recovery approach for finite-lived intangible assets, uses estimates for future market growth, forecasted revenue and costs and selected discount rates. Changes to these estimates, including the inability to attain forecasted revenue and cost expectations, could result in the recognition of a future impairment loss.
Pension and Post-retirement Benefits
Pension and post-retirement benefit costs and credits are developed from third-party actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates and expected return on plan assets. The Company considers current market conditions, including changes in interest rates, in selecting these assumptions. Changes in the related pension and post-retirement benefit costs or credits may occur in the future as a result of fluctuations in the Company’s headcount, changes in actuarial assumptions and market performance.
Self-Insurance
The Company is self-insured for a portion of its insurable risks. The Company analyzes its historical claims experience and other information provided by the Company’s administrators in determining an adequate liability for self-insured claims, both reported and incurred but not reported claims.
Income Taxes
The Company uses the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets when realization is not considered to be more-likely-than-not. Interest and penalties on tax positions are recognized as a component of tax expense.
The Company takes various positions regarding deductions and income reported for tax purposes within its federal and state income tax returns. On January 1, 2007, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes which requires income tax positions be recognized through the tax provision of the financial statements based on a more-likely-than-not criterion that the relevant tax authority would sustain the tax position. For all positions assessed as more-likely-than-not to be sustainable, the amount recognized is based on relative probabilities of the amount allowed by the tax authorities. If the Company expects that the position will not be more-likely-than-not to be sustained by the tax authority, the Company does not recognize any of the benefit in the consolidated financial statements; accordingly, it reports a liability and, if applicable, interest and penalties are accrued on this position based on existing statutes. If these unrecognized positions are settled or agreed to by the tax authority, the position is recognized in the consolidated financial statements at the time that the decision is reached with the tax authority or the tax year is closed to further adjustment.
Litigation
The Company is involved in litigation matters that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes that the outcome of these legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is earned from the sale of advertising, circulation and commercial printing. Advertising revenues are recognized, net of agency discounts, in the period when advertising is printed in the Company’s publications or placed on the Company’s Web sites. Circulation revenues are recognized when
purchased newspapers are distributed. Amounts received from customers in advance of revenue recognition are deferred as liabilities.
Acquisitions and Dispositions
On March 29, 2006, the Company completed the acquisition of the assets of the Suburban Lifestyles Community Newspaper Group (‘‘Suburban Lifestyles’’). Based in Rochester Hills, Michigan, Suburban Lifestyles publications are distributed in many of the affluent neighborhoods of Oakland and Macomb Counties and focus on local news and information in each of the communities served. Suburban Lifestyles has been integrated into the Michigan Cluster.
On December 6, 2005, the Company completed the acquisition of the assets of JobsInTheUS (‘‘JIUS’’), based in Westbrook, Maine. This acquisition included the online recruiting Web sites of JobsInTheUS.com, JobsInME.com, JobsInNH.com, JobsInVT.com, JobsInRI.com, JobsInMA.com and other domain names. Founded in 1999, JIUS specializes in state-specific employment Internet sites where qualified candidates who want to work in a particular region find a match with local employers.
Consistent with management’s strategy of continually reevaluating resources, the Company sold its New England Cluster newspaper operations in February 2007. These dispositions eliminated 5 daily newspapers with circulation of approximately 56,800, and 24 non-daily newspapers with circulation of approximately 336,000. Management believes that this allows the Company to focus its efforts on those operations, including growth in online initiatives, which generate a higher return on capital and produce a higher level of profitability and cash flow.
Results of Operations
Executive Summary
For the fiscal year ended December 30, 2007, a 52 week period (‘‘fiscal year 2007’’), the Company incurred a consolidated net loss of $102.5 million, or $(2.62) per share, as compared to a net loss of $6.2 million, or $(0.16) per share, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, a 53 week period (‘‘fiscal year 2006’’), and net income of $46.9 million, or $1.12 per diluted share, for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2005, a 52 week period (‘‘fiscal year 2005’’).

• The acquisitions of Suburban Lifestyles in March 2006 and JobsInTheUS in December 2005 added revenue and an aggregate operating loss of $1.4 million to the Company’s reported results for fiscal year 2006, as compared to fiscal year 2005. The Company includes the results of acquisitions from the date purchased.
• In fiscal year 2006, the Company wrote down its investment in PowerOne Media LLC (‘‘PowerOne’’) resulting in a $2.4 million charge ($1.4 million after tax).
Fiscal Year Ended December 30, 2007 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2006
The discussion presented below compares a fifty-two week period with a fifty-three week period. During 2006, the Company classified its New England newspaper operations as discontinued operations. The discussion which follows reflects changes in and measurements of continuing operations only, unless otherwise specified.
Summary
The Company incurred a loss for fiscal year 2007 continuing operations of $130.1 million, or $3.32 per share, as compared to a loss of $9.7 million, or $0.25 per share, for fiscal year 2006.
The Company’s reported revenues were $463.2 million for fiscal year 2007 as compared to $506.1 million for fiscal year 2006, a decrease of 8.5 percent. Fiscal year 2006 benefited from an extra week of revenue and absent this extra week, total revenues declined 7.1 percent. Advertising revenues decreased $40.2 million, or 10.2 percent, and circulation revenues decreased $1.9 million, or 2.1 percent. Online revenues for fiscal year 2007, which are included in advertising revenues, were approximately $18.0 million, an increase of approximately 22.8 percent as compared to the prior year. Commercial printing and other revenues for fiscal year 2007 decreased $0.7 million, or 3.6 percent, to $18.6 million as compared to the prior year, and represented approximately 4.0 percent of the Company’s revenues for fiscal year 2007.
Advertising Revenue by Performance Category
The following table sets forth the Company’s total advertising revenues, from continuing operations by category, for fiscal years 2007 and 2006:
Local. Local advertising revenues for fiscal year 2007 decreased $18.9 million or 8.7 percent as compared to fiscal year 2006 largely due to a general decline in advertising across all categories of advertisers with significant shortfall in the financial and building/hardware categories.
Classified. Classified advertising revenues decreased $17.5 million or 11.0 percent for fiscal year 2007 as compared to fiscal year 2006. Real estate advertising revenues decreased 17.9 percent in fiscal year 2007 period as compared to the prior year, with all of the Company’s clusters reporting decreases. Classified employment advertising revenues decreased for fiscal year 2007 by 6.6 percent compared to fiscal 2006. Revenue from classified automotive advertising decreased $6.1 million or 18.4 percent for fiscal year 2007 as compared to the same prior year period. The classified automotive revenue decline was due to a soft economy and increased competition for automotive classified advertising dollars. Classified other advertising revenues decreased $0.9 million or 2.4 percent for fiscal year 2007, as compared to fiscal year 2006.
National. National advertising revenues, which represent approximately four percent of the Company’s advertising revenues, decreased $3.9 million or 21.7 percent for fiscal year 2007, as compared to fiscal year 2006.
Operating Expenses
Salaries and employee benefits. Salaries and employee benefit expenses were 41.8 percent of the Company’s total revenues for fiscal year 2007, compared to 40.7 percent for fiscal year 2006. Salaries and employee benefits decreased $12.0 million, or 5.8 percent, in fiscal year 2007 to $193.8 million as compared to $205.8 million in the prior year. The decrease in salaries and employee benefits in fiscal year 2007 as compared to fiscal year 2006 is primarily due to lower headcount in fiscal year 2007 as compared to 2006 and a favorable change in pension benefits as a result of freezing the pension plan benefits and converting to a 401(k) Safe Harbor plan for retirement savings. Total company headcount was lower by 8.8 percent when compared to 2006. Most of this reduction came as a result of the integration of the Michigan cluster with the Company. The Company also had other consolidations of operations during the year which contributed to the lower headcount. This lower headcount in the Company’s print operations was offset by increases in online personnel. Additionally, both years include charges for the separation of certain executives. 2007 included a charge of $6.9 million for the separation arrangements and 2006 included $3.6 million related to the 2006 separation arrangement. Excluding these charges from the respective year, salaries and employee benefits declined by 7.6 percent in 2007.
Newsprint, ink and printing charges. For fiscal year 2007, newsprint, ink and printing charges were 9.4 percent of the Company’s revenues, as compared to 9.8 percent for fiscal year 2006. Newsprint, ink and printing charges decreased $6.0 million, or 12.2 percent, for fiscal year 2007 to $43.4 million as compared to the prior year. The Company’s newsprint expense decreased approximately 15.8 percent for the fiscal year 2007 as compared to the prior year, reflecting a decrease in consumption of approximately 10.3 percent and a 6.1 percent decrease in unit cost. Ink and printing charges decreased approximately 2.0 percent in fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal year 2006.
Selling, general and administrative and other operating expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses together with other operating expenses were 31.0 percent and 28.1 percent of the Company’s revenues for fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses together with other operating expenses increased $1.3 million, or 0.9 percent, for fiscal year 2007 to $143.5 million as compared to the prior year of $142.2 million. The majority of the increase was related to promotional costs for JobsInTheUS as it expanded into new states, promotional costs of Yahoo! HotJobs as this program became operational in March 2007, increased online spending, and a full year of expenses for the acquisition of Suburban Lifestyles which was acquired in March 2006. JobsInTheUS expanded operations into Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana in the first quarter of 2007. A decrease in professional fees and the cessation of a promotion program in 2007 was partially offset by increases in software maintenance and utilities costs. Other operating expenses, which consists primarily of circulation and delivery costs, decreased 2.0 percent in fiscal year 2007, reflecting a comparable decrease in circulation revenue.
Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $1.4 million, or 8.0 percent, from $18.1 million to $19.5 million for fiscal year 2007 as compared to fiscal year 2006. Depreciation and amortization expenses were 4.2 and 3.6 percent of the Company’s revenues for fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively. This increase is due to: new assets being put in service during the fiscal year related to various information technology development projects; major upgrades to production
capabilities in Lake County, Ohio, which allowed the Company to combine its printing operations for its Ohio cluster newspapers; and the completion of the Macomb press facility which went into production in July 2007.
Operating (loss) income. The Company reported an operating loss of $118.3 million for fiscal 2007 and operating income of $56.9 million for fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2007 reflects a write-down of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles amounting to $181.3 million. Fiscal 2006 reflects a write-down of goodwill amounting to $33.7 million. Excluding these charges from both years, operating income was $63.0 million, or 13.6 percent of the Company’s revenues, for the fiscal year 2007 as compared to $90.5 million, or 17.9 percent of the Company’s revenues, for the fiscal year 2006. The decrease in operating income was attributable to the decline in revenues of $42.9 million partially offset by cost control measures put in place in 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. The Company’s cost control measures have resulted in non-newsprint cash expense savings of $21.8 million in fiscal year 2007 as compared to fiscal year 2006 after adjustment for the separation arrangements in both fiscal years. Included in non-newsprint operating expenses for the fiscal year 2007 was $10.6 million of costs related to the Company’s online initiatives which increased by $3.3 million compared to the same period in 2006. The increase in online expenses reduced the benefit of the aforementioned cost control measures in 2007. Online initiatives will continue to be a focus of the Company and should be expected in the future.
Interest expense, net. Interest expense decreased $0.8 million, or 1.8 percent, from $44.4 million in fiscal year 2006 to $43.6 million in fiscal year 2007. This decrease was primarily due to lower weighted average debt outstanding offset by higher prevailing interest rates on the Company’s debt during fiscal year 2007 as compared to fiscal year 2006. The Company’s weighted average interest rate increased to approximately 6.5 percent for fiscal year 2007 from approximately 5.9 percent in fiscal year 2006.
