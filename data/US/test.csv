MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Overview
DuPont Fabros Technology, Inc. (“DFT”) is a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, that owns, acquires, develops and operates wholesale data centers. DFT is the sole general partner of, and, as of December 31, 2016, owned 84.9% of the common economic interest in DuPont Fabros Technology, L.P. (the “Operating Partnership” or “OP”). Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references to “we,” “us,” “our,” “our Company” or “the Company” refer to DFT and the Operating Partnership, collectively.
We design and operate innovative, multi-tenant, wholesale data centers, and create solutions with our customers that free them to focus on their core businesses. Our facilities are designed to offer highly specialized, efficient and safe computing environments in a low-cost operating model. Our customers include national and international enterprises across numerous industries, including technology, Internet, content providers, cloud providers, media, communications, healthcare and financial services. Our 11 data centers have a total of 3.3 million gross square feet and 287 megawatts of power available to our customers to operate their servers and computing equipment. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we generated $528.7 million of total revenues, net income of $181.4 million and cash provided by operating activities of $290.0 million. As of December 31, 2016, we had total assets of $3.0 billion.
Data centers are facilities that house large numbers of computer servers and related equipment and include the infrastructure necessary to operate this equipment, including systems for power distribution, environmental control, fire suppression and security. We believe that our data centers provide sufficient power to meet the needs of the world's largest technology companies. We lease the computer room square feet, or CRSF, and the available power of our facilities to customers under long-term leases. As of January 1, 2017:
•
We had 32 customers with 124 different lease expirations, with only 14.2% of these expirations occurring over the next two years as measured by annualized base rent;
•
The weighted average remaining term of our leases at our operating data centers was 5.4 years; and
•
We served five of the Fortune 25 and 20 of the Fortune 1000, which includes private or foreign enterprises of equivalent size.
Our data centers are strategically located in three major population centers - Northern Virginia, suburban Chicago, Illinois and Santa Clara, California. We have acquired property and have plans to expand into two new markets - the greater Toronto area, and the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area. Each of our current and expansion markets has significant electrical power availability and hubs of extensive fiber network connectivity. As of December 31, 2016, we owned the following properties:
•
11 operating data centers facilities;
•
Five phases of existing data center facilities under development;
•
One shell of a data center currently under development;
•
Two data center facilities with a phase or phases available for future development; and
•
Parcels of land held for future development of four data centers.
We believe that we are well positioned to develop, lease, operate and manage our growing data center portfolio.
We derive substantially all of our revenue from rents received from customers. For most of our customers, and we believe for most potential wholesale data center customers, the amount of available power is the primary factor used to evaluate their data center requirements. Consequently, rents under our leases are based primarily on the amount of power made available to our customers, rather than the amount of space that they occupy. The term “critical load” is used to indicate that portion of each facility's total power capacity that is made available for the exclusive use of its customers to operate their computer servers. Accordingly, throughout this Form 10-K, we discuss our operations in terms of available critical load because it is one of the primary metrics that we use to manage our business. We also provide information relating to each facility's total gross building area and its computer room square feet (""CRSF""), which is the net rentable area of each of our facilities.
We also provide certain technical services to customers as a contractor on a purchase order basis, including layout design and installation of electrical power circuits, data cabling, server cabinets and racks, computer room airflow analyses and monitoring and other services requested by customers.

Business Strategy
Our goal is to diversify our customer base and improve our profitability by expanding our geographic presence and supplementing our portfolio with flexible wholesale products. We will continue to serve the wholesale segment of the data center market exclusively. We will capitalize on our exceptional skill in data center design, development and operations as we build-out our development pipeline and maximize cash flow from our existing properties. Specifically, we will expand our geographic presence; diversify our portfolio with flexible wholesale products to meet a variety of power density, redundancy and deployment needs and continue to prudently build-out our development pipeline.
Expand Our Geographic Presence. Our primary focus in the past has been to develop and lease data center space in the three markets in which we operate. Over the next several years, we plan to expand our data center development and operations into several new markets, which we believe will create opportunities to diversify our customer base and increase our profitability. We plan to target two new markets that we believe will satisfy demand of wholesale customers. Initially, we intend to focus our development efforts in the Toronto, Ontario and Portland, Oregon markets, where we believe that there will be strong demand for wholesale data centers even though the development of a wholesale market in these markets is in its infancy.
In July 2016, we purchased a 46.7 acre parcel of land in the Portland market, and in September 2016, we purchased a shell building and associated land in the Toronto market. The building in Toronto is a former Toronto Star printing facility, and the shell is well-suited for development of our TOR1 data center. We have begun development of Phase IA of TOR1 and expect to deliver this phase later in 2017.
Diversify our portfolio with flexible wholesale products to meet a variety of power density, redundancy and deployment needs. The data center requirements of prospective customers vary greatly between the Internet, cloud and technology industries, on the one hand, and enterprises, on the other. There are three key areas where customer requirements vary:
•
Power Density, which is the amount of power available in a fixed amount of space. Many Internet, cloud and technology customers require “high-density” space, or a large amount of power relative to the space, while many enterprise customers require “low density” space, or a smaller amount of power relative to the space. Our more recent data center facility designs (ACC6 Phase II, ACC7, ACC9, CH2, CH3 and SC1 Phase II) provide some flexibility to meet different customers’ density requirements, but we have developed a new design that will enable us to meet a larger variety of density requirements for different customers within a single facility. This new design will be deployed in the Toronto, Ontario and Portland, Oregon markets.
•
Redundancy, which means the number of additional power distribution, cooling units and back-up diesel engine generators included in a facility design to back-up units that are off-line for maintenance or due to a malfunction. Each of our current operating data center facilities are designed with “N+2” redundancy, which means that our facilities include two sets of power distribution systems and back-up diesel engine generators in addition to the number of these sets of units necessary to provide the power contracted by our customers. Our facilities also have this level of redundancy for our mechanical plants, which regulate the environment of the computer rooms leased by our customers. We believe that some customers require N+1 redundancy or less, and that a few customers may require redundancy more robust than N+2. Consequently, we have developed a new data center design that will enable us to meet diverse redundancy requirements of potential customers within a single facility. This new design will be deployed in the Toronto, Canada and Portland, Oregon markets. Additionally, our CH3 and ACC10 data centers, while based on our current design, will be developed with N+1 redundancy.
•
Deployment needs, which relates to the time that it takes to construct a phase of a facility and ready it for a customer’s operations. Although we generally commence development of a data center facility prior to having received any commitments from customers to lease any space in the facility - commonly known as developing “on speculation” - we have found that customers often need data center space within very specific, and often short, time frames. Although our current data center development time lines allow for rapid deployment of computer room space, we have completed a new design that we believe will improve our development times and allow us to meet specific customer requirements for available computer room space.
Continue to prudently build-out our development pipeline. We determine when to develop data center properties based on the amount of available space in our operating properties and anticipated demand for data center space in each applicable market. Our development projects as of December 31, 2016 included:
•
ACC9 Phase I - 14.4 MW of available critical load which is 20% pre-leased as of February 23, 2017, with completion expected in the second quarter of 2017;
•
ACC9 Phase II - 14.4 MW of available critical load with completion expected in the third quarter of 2017;
•
SC1 Phase III - 16.0 MW of available critical load which is 100% pre-leased, with completion expected in the third quarter of 2017;
•
TOR1 Phase IA - 6.0 MW of available critical load with completion expected in the third quarter of 2017;
•
CH3 Phase I - 13.6 MW of available critical load with completion expected in the first quarter of 2018; and
•
ACC10 shell is currently in development. Building the shell now will allow us to deliver phases I and II quicker as demand warrants.
The remaining phases of TOR1, comprising 28.5 MW, and the second phase of CH3, comprising 13.6 MW, are being held for future development. We also own parcels of land available to develop four additional data centers, two of which are in the Ashburn, Virginia market and the other two are in the Portland, Oregon market.
The following table presents a summary of our operating properties as of January 1, 2017:

(3)
Annualized base rent represents the monthly contractual base rent (defined as cash base rent before abatements) multiplied by 12 for commenced leases as of January 1, 2017.
(4)
A customer at ACC4 whose lease expires on July 31, 2017 has informed us that they do not intend to renew this lease. This lease is for 1.14 MW and 5,400 CRSF. Additionally, a customer at ACC6, whose lease expires on August 31, 2017, has informed us that they do not intend to renew this lease. This lease is for 0.54 MW and 2,523 CRSF. These leases total 0.9% of Annualized Base Rent. We are marketing these computer rooms for re-lease.
As of January 1, 2017, our operating property portfolio had 32 data center customers with 124 lease expiration dates. As of January 1, 2017, as described below, we had leases with our largest customer that have 29 lease expiration dates ranging from December 31, 2017 to September 30, 2031, with various renewal rights and, with respect to six lease expiration dates, an option to terminate the lease prior to the expiration date. Also, as discussed below, as of January 1, 2017, we had leases with our second largest customer that have 17 lease expiration dates ranging from June 30, 2018 to February 28, 2023, with various renewal rights and, with respect to its ACC5 lease, an option to decrease the term of the lease of each of nine of its existing computer rooms, provided the aggregate reduction in lease term does not exceed 67 months, or an average of approximately seven months per computer room.
Some leases with certain other customers include options to terminate leases prior to the expiration date. For instance, as of January 1, 2017, we had commenced leases with our third largest customer in three of our data centers with 12 expiration dates ranging from September 30, 2021 to June 30, 2022. This customer has an option to renew the term of each of these lease expiration dates for five years. With respect to six of these lease expiration dates, this customer has the option to make a termination payment and terminate these leases on September 30, 2018. These leases are shown as expiring in 2018 in the Lease Expiration Table above. Also, as of January 1, 2017, we had commenced leases with our fourth largest customer in three of our data centers with nine expiration dates ranging from June 30, 2024 to December 31, 2033. This customer has the option to renew the term of each of these lease expiration dates for five years. With respect to six of its lease expiration dates, this customer has the option to make a termination payment and terminate these leases after ten years of the respective lease terms with expiration dates ranging from June 30, 2019 to May 31, 2024. These lease expiration dates are shown as expiring after ten years in the Lease Expiration Table above. In addition, as of January 1, 2017, we had commenced leases with our fifth largest customer in four of our data centers with 12 expiration dates ranging from July 31, 2022 to March 31, 2026. This customer has
the option to renew the term of two of these lease expiration dates for between one and five years and 10 leases with an option to renew for five years. This customer has an option on ten lease expiration dates to make a termination payment and terminate the lease on dates ranging from March 31, 2018 to June 30, 2022. Two of these leases are shown as expiring March 31, 2018. Certain other customers have similar rights to terminate leases prior to their expiration dates.
Same Store Analysis
As of December 31, 2016
($ in thousands)
The following tables set forth an analysis of our same store and same store, same capital operating property portfolio for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016. Same store properties represent those properties placed into service on or before January 1, 2015 and owned by the Company as of December 31, 2016, include all of our operating properties except CH2, due to its first phase being placed into service in July 2015 and NJ1, due to it being sold in June 2016. Accordingly, same store properties represented 260.3 MW, or 91%, of the 287.1 MW of operating properties in service as of December 31, 2016. Same store, same capital properties represent those operating properties that were placed into service on or before January 1, 2015, that were owned by the Company as of December 31, 2016 and that have less than 10% of additional critical load developed after January 1, 2015. Accordingly, our same store, same capital properties include all of our operating properties with the exception of CH2 and NJ1, for the reasons described above, ACC7, due to Phase II of this facility being placed into service in December 2015, Phase III being placed into service in June 2016 and Phase IV being placed into service in October 2016, each of which increased the critical load of ACC7 by over 10%, and SC1, due to phase IIB of this facility being placed into service in May 2015, which increased the critical load at SC1 by over 10%. Same store, same capital properties represented 182.1 MW, or 63%, of the 287.1 MW of operating properties in service as of December 31, 2016.
Same Store Analysis - Reconciliations of Operating Income
to Net Operating Income and Cash Net Operating Income (1)
($ in thousands)
(1)
Net Operating Income (""NOI"") represents total revenues less property operating costs, real estate taxes and insurance, and other expenses(each as reflected in the consolidated statements of operations) for the properties included in the analysis. Cash Net Operating Income (""Cash NOI"") is NOI less straight-line revenues, net of reserve and amortization of lease contracts above and below market value for the properties included in the analysis.
We use NOI and Cash NOI as supplemental performance measures because, in excluding depreciation and amortization, impairment charges on depreciable real estate assets and gains and losses from property dispositions, each provides a performance measure that, when compared period over period, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating expenses. However, because NOI and Cash NOI exclude depreciation and amortization, impairment charges on depreciable real estate assets and gains and losses from property dispositions, and capture neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact our results from operations, the utility of NOI and Cash NOI as a measure of our performance is limited.
Other REITs may not calculate NOI and Cash NOI in the same manner we do and, accordingly, our NOI and Cash NOI may not be comparable to the NOI and Cash NOI of other REITs. NOI and Cash NOI should not be considered as an alternative to operating income (as computed in accordance with GAAP).
The following table presents a summary of our development properties as of December 31, 2016:
Development Projects
As of December 31, 2016
($ in thousands)
(1)
Gross building area is the entire building area, including CRSF (the portion of gross building area where our customers’ computer servers are located), common areas, areas controlled by us (such as the mechanical, telecommunications and utility rooms) and, in some facilities, individual office and storage space leased on an as available basis to our customers. The respective amounts listed for each of the “Land Held for Development” sites are estimates.

Amounts listed for gross building area, CRSF and critical load are current estimates.
Leasing
We derive substantially all of our revenue from rents received from customers under existing leases at each of our operating properties. Because we believe that critical load is the primary factor used by customers in evaluating data center requirements, rents are based primarily on the amount of power that is made available to customers, rather than the amount of space that they occupy. During 2016, we executed 14 leases totaling 50.93 MW of critical load and 267,662 CRSF of space
with a weighted average lease term of 12.2 years. The leases executed in 2016 are expected to generate approximately $63.3 million of annualized GAAP base rent revenue, which is equivalent to a GAAP rate of approximately $104 per kW per month. Including estimated amounts of operating expense recoveries for those leases that are structured as triple-net leases, these leases are expected to generate approximately $79.4 million of annualized GAAP revenue before recovery of metered power, which results in a GAAP rate of approximately $130 per kW per month. These leases included the following:
•
Three leases at ACC7 Phase III comprising 11.52 MW of critical load and 68,408 CRSF,
•
Two leases at ACC7 Phase IV comprising 4.00 MW of critical load and 21,363 CRSF,
•
One pre-lease at ACC9 Phase I comprising 2.88 MW and 18,000 CRSF,
•
One lease at CH2 Phase I comprising 0.58 MW, which was an increase in power related to an existing lease,
•
Two leases at CH2 Phase II comprising 3.42 MW of critical load and 17,830 CRSF,
•
Three leases at CH2 Phase III comprising 11.33 MW of critical load and 70,686 CRSF,
•
One lease at CH2 Phase IV comprising 1.20 MW of critical load and 7,375 CRSF and
•
One pre-lease at SC1 Phase III comprising the entire 16.00 MW of critical load and 64,000 CRSF of this facility.
In 2016, we also extended the terms of eight leases totaling 7.97 MW and 54,139 CRSF by a weighted average of 2.3 years. The lease terms that we extended were as follows:
•
One extension at ACC4 comprising 1.14 MW of critical load and 5,400 CRSF,
•
Two extensions at ACC5 comprising 3.41 MW of critical load and 16,400 CRSF,
•
One extension at ACC6 comprising 0.54 MW of critical load and 2,517 CRSF,
•
One extension at NJ1 comprising 0.28 MW of critical load and 1,385 CRSF and
•
Three extensions at VA3 comprising 2.60 MW of critical load and 28,437 CRSF
During 2015, we executed 19 leases representing a total of 46.83 MW of critical load and 269,973 CRSF of space with a weighted average lease term of 6.6 years. We also extended the terms of seven leases totaling 12.24 MW of critical load and 69,081 CRSF by a weighted average of 3.0 years.
We generally lease space and power to our customers using a “triple net” lease structure, under which our customers occupy all or a percentage of each of our data centers and, in addition to a monthly base rent fee, are obligated to reimburse us for their share of property-level operating expenses. We also have begun to market space and power to customers under a “full service” lease structure, under which the customer's reimbursement for operating expenses is fixed with annual escalators, excluding increases to certain uncontrollable expenses. We believe the rental rates for full service leases will cover these operating expenses and will provide us with an adequate return on our investment. We signed twelve triple net leases and two full service leases in 2016. Under all of our leases, customers reimburse us for the cost of the power they use to operate their computer servers and the power that is used to cool their space. We believe that these lease structures, together with the economies of scale resulting from the size of our data centers, result in our customers paying less for power and operating expenses over time than they would in a comparable colocation setting, where power costs are often included in the license fee paid to the provider. Most of our leases provide for annual rent increases, and, as of January 1, 2017, our weighted average remaining lease term for commenced leases was approximately 5.4 years.
As of January 1, 2017, our operating property portfolio had 32 data center customers with 124 different lease expiration dates. As of January 1, 2017, our largest customer, Microsoft, accounted for 25.4% of our annualized base rent. As of January 1, 2017, we had commenced leases with Microsoft in nine of our data centers with 29 lease expiration dates ranging from December 31, 2017 to September 30, 2031 and options by Microsoft to renew six of these lease expiration dates from six months to five years, 12 expiration dates for five years and two expiration dates from one to five years. Nine of these lease expiration dates have no renewal options. In addition, Microsoft has early termination options for six of its lease expiration dates. For one expiration date, Microsoft has the right to make a termination payment and terminate this lease on either March 31, 2021 or March 31, 2026. This lease is shown as expiring in 2021 in the Lease Expiration Table. For three other expiration dates, Microsoft has the right to make a termination payment and terminate these leases on either June 30, 2026 or July 31, 2026. For two other lease expiration dates, Microsoft has the right to make a termination payment and terminate these leases on September 30, 2026. These last five expiration dates are shown as expiring in 2031 in the Lease Expiration Table after taking
into account the termination payment options relative to the remaining payments due under each lease. Please visit www.microsoft.com to obtain this customer's SEC filed financial information.
As of January 1, 2017, our second largest customer, Facebook, accounted for 20.2% of our annualized base rent. As of January 1, 2017, we had commenced leases with Facebook in four of our data centers with 17 lease expiration dates ranging from June 30, 2018 to February 28, 2023 and an option by Facebook to renew the term of the lease of any computer room by a duration of between 6 months and 5 years. Facebook has the right to decrease the term of the lease of each of nine of its existing computer rooms in ACC5, each with 2.28 MW of available critical load, provided the aggregate reduction in lease term does not exceed 67 months, or an average of approximately seven months per computer room.
Available Data Center Inventory and Current Development Projects
As of February 23, 2017, our operating portfolio was 99% leased and commenced as measured by CRSF and critical load. The opportunity for further revenue growth in the near term depends primarily on our ability to pre-lease space in our data center projects under development. As described above, we have 64.4 MW of available critical load under development as of February 23, 2017, which was 29% pre-leased as of February 23, 2017.
Market Conditions
Changes in the conditions of any of the markets in which our operating properties are located, including the economic conditions of a market, the financial condition of customers that procure data center space in a market, and the supply of available data center space in a market, will impact the overall performance of our current and future operating properties and our ability to fully lease our properties. The ability of our customers to fulfill their lease commitments could be impacted by future economic or regional downturns in the markets in which we operate or downturns in the industries in which our customers operate.
We take into account various factors when negotiating the terms of our leases, which can vary among leases, including the following factors: the customer’s strategic importance, growth prospects and credit quality, the length of the lease term, the amount of power leased and competitive market conditions. To determine credit quality, if a prospective customer is a publicly held entity, we evaluate its publicly filed financial statements. If a prospective customer is a privately held entity, we request audited financial statements from the customer if they exist, and unaudited financial statements if audited financial statements do not exist. We also consider any relevant news, market or industry data related to a prospective or existing customer. Furthermore, we also evaluate an existing customer's payment history with us.
We have been able to lease space and power at rates that provide a favorable return on the investment we have made in each of our operating data center facilities. There is significant competition in each of the markets in which we operate. Our primary competitors operate and are expanding their presence in our markets, and other data center providers are entering some of our markets, including the Northern Virginia market in particular. This competition could impact the rental rates adversely and, in turn, the rates of return of our investments. The rental rates of a number of leases in our portfolio that we negotiated several years ago are higher than rental rates under current market conditions. If, upon the expiration of the terms of these leases, these customers either vacate their space or negotiate the rental rates that reflect current market conditions, our rates of return would be impacted adversely. We believe that the base rents of our portfolio of operating properties in the aggregate exceed base rents that currently exist in our relevant markets. Because the terms of the leases in our portfolio expire over a weighted average period of 5.4 years as of January 1, 2017, we cannot predict how the base rents of any of our leases will compare to the market rates at the time that the terms of our leases expire. If we are unable to renew leases as their terms expire or lease vacated space with rents equal to or above historic rates, the returns on our investments we have achieved to date at our operating properties would be impacted negatively.

Overview
We are a blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting an initial business combination. We are focusing our search on businesses that are providing or changing technology for traditional financial services with an equity value of approximately $500 million to $2,000 million. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of the placement units, the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our initial business combination (pursuant to backstop agreements we may enter into), shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing.
The issuance of additional shares in connection with an initial business combination to the owners of the target or other investors:
● may significantly dilute the equity interest of investors in our initial public offering, which dilution would increase if the anti-dilution provisions in the Class B common stock resulted in the issuance of Class A shares on a greater than one-to-one basis upon conversion of the Class B common stock;
● may subordinate the rights of holders of our common stock if preferred stock is issued with rights senior to those afforded our common stock;
● could cause a change in control if a substantial number of shares of our common stock is issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors;
● may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us by diluting the stock ownership or voting rights of a person seeking to obtain control of us; and
● may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our Class A common stock and/or warrants.
Similarly, if we issue debt securities or otherwise incur significant debt to bank or other lenders or the owners of a target, it could result in:
● default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after an initial business combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations;
● acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant;
● our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand;
● our inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt security is outstanding;
● our inability to pay dividends on our common stock;
● using a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends on our common stock if declared, our ability to pay expenses, make capital expenditures and acquisitions, and fund other general corporate purposes;
● limitations on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate;
● increased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation;
● limitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, and execution of our strategy; and
● other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt.
We expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our initial business combination. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete our initial business combination, such as the Katapult Business Combination, will be successful.
Recent Developments
On December 18, 2020, we entered into the Merger Agreement with the Merger Subs, Katapult, and the other signatories thereto.
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the “Transaction” and the “Closing”, respectively), a business combination between us and Katapult will be effected through the merger of Merger Sub 1 with and into Katapult, with Katapult surviving as the surviving company and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the “First Merger”), followed immediately by the merger of the resulting company with and into Merger Sub 2, with Merger Sub 2 surviving as the surviving company and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Second Merger” and together with the First Merger, the “Mergers”). Once effective, all equity securities of Katapult will be converted into the right to receive the applicable portion of merger consideration pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement.
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the aggregate consideration to be paid in the Mergers is $833,000,000, as adjusted in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement and apportioned between cash and our common stock (“FinServ Common Shares”), and which shall be adjusted to account for the value of Assumed Options (as defined below). In addition, we will issue to the Pre-Closing Holders an aggregate 7,500,000 restricted FinServ Common Shares.
At the effective time of the First Merger (the “Effective Time”), each Katapult Common Share (as defined below) that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than dissenting shares and shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Katapult (“Katapult Common Shares”) will be canceled and converted into the right to receive the applicable portion of the merger consideration in accordance with an allocation schedule to be provided by Katapult (the “Allocation Schedule”) that will set forth the allocation of the merger consideration (including the Earn-Out Shares (as defined below)) among the equityholders of Katapult.
As of the Effective Time, (a) certain shares of restricted stock in Katapult will vest and the holders thereof be entitled to receive the applicable portion of the merger consideration in accordance with the Allocation Schedule and (b) certain holders of options to purchase Katapult Common Shares will receive options to purchase FinServ Common Shares (the “Assumed Options”) and, if applicable, Earn-Out Shares.
Earn-Out
At the Closing, we will also issue to the Pre-Closing Holders an aggregate 7,500,000 restricted FinServ Common Shares (subject to vesting, forfeiture and certain other restrictions (including on transfer) set forth in the Merger Agreement (the “Earn-Out Shares”)). With respect to the Earn-Out Shares: (i) one-half (1/2) of the Earn-Out Shares will vest if the closing price of the FinServ Common Shares is greater than or equal to $12.00 over any twenty (20) Trading Days (as defined in the Merger Agreement) within any thirty (30) consecutive Trading Day period and (ii) one-half (1/2) of the Earn-Out Shares will vest if the closing price of the FinServ Common Shares is greater than or equal to $14.00 over any twenty (20) Trading Days within any thirty (30) consecutive Trading Day period, in each case, during the Earn-Out Period (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and subject to adjustments as a result of certain recapitalization events and dividends paid prior to the expiration of the Earn-Out Period. In addition, if there is a Change of Control Transaction (as defined in the Merger Agreement) of the Company prior to the expiration of the Earn-Out Period that will result in the holders of FinServ Common Shares receiving a price per share equal to or in excess of the applicable price per share thresholds described above, then Earn-Out Shares will vest in connection with such Change of Control Transaction in the manner set forth in the Merger Agreement.
The Transactions will be consummated subject to the deliverables and provisions as further described in the Merger Agreement.
Results of Operations
We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities since inception have been organizational activities and those necessary to prepare for our initial public offering and identifying a target for our initial business combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after completion of our initial business combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable securities held in the trust account. We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as expenses as we conduct due diligence on prospective initial business combination candidates.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had a net income of $154,152, which consists of interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $1,133,614 and interest income on our money market account of $12,294, offset by operating costs of $795,708 and a provision for income taxes of $196,048.
For the period from August 9, 2019 (inception) through December 31, 2019, we had a net income of $292,962, which consists of interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $567,358, offset by operating costs of $171,946 and a provision for income taxes of $102,450.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
On November 5, 2019, we consummated our initial public offering of 25,000,000 Units, which included the partial exercise by the underwriters of the over-allotment option to purchase an additional 3,000,000 Units, at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $250,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering, we consummated the sale of 665,500 placement units to the sponsor at a price of $10.00 per placement unit, generating gross proceeds of $6,650,000.
Following our initial public offering, the exercise of the over-allotment option and the sale of the placement units, a total of $250,000,000 was placed in the trust account. We incurred $14,267,762 in transaction costs, including $4,400,000 of underwriting fees, $9,350,000 of deferred underwriting fees and $517,762 of other offering costs.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, cash used in operating activities was $985,959. Net loss of $154,152 was affected by interest earned on marketable securities held in the trust account of $1,133,614 and changes in operating assets and liabilities, which used $6,497 of cash from operating activities.
For the period from August 9, 2019 (inception) through December 31, 2019, cash used in operating activities was $156,163. Net income of $292,962 was impacted by interest earned on marketable securities held in the trust account of $567,358, formation costs paid by a related party of $1,000 and changes in operating assets and liabilities, which provided $117,233 of cash from operating activities.
As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and marketable securities of $251,249,193 held in the trust account. We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the trust account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the trust account (less deferred underwriting commissions) to complete our initial business combination. We may withdraw interest to pay taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we withdrew approximately $452,000 of interest earned on the trust account to pay for our franchise and income taxes. To the extent that our capital stock or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our initial business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the trust account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies.
As of December 31, 2020, we had cash of $1,043,895 outside of the trust account. We intend to use the funds held outside the trust account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete our initial business combination.
In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with our initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that our initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into units identical to the placement units, at a price of $10.00 per unit at the option of the lender.
We do not currently believe we will need to raise additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business. However, if our estimate of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating our initial business combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our initial business combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our initial business combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon consummation of our initial business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such initial business combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account. In addition, following our initial business combination, if cash on hand is insufficient, we may need to obtain additional financing in order to meet our obligations.
In connection with our assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board’s Accounting Standards Update 2014-15, “Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,” we have until November 5, 2021 to consummate an initial business combination. It is uncertain that we will be able to consummate an initial business combination by this time. If an initial business combination is not consummated by this date, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution. Management has determined that the mandatory liquidation, should an initial business combination not occur, and potential subsequent dissolution, raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should we be required to liquidate after November 5, 2021.
Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements
We have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2020. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets.
Contractual Obligations
We do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than an agreement to pay an affiliate of the sponsor a monthly fee of $10,000 for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support to the Company. We began incurring these fees on November 5, 2019 and will continue to incur these fees monthly until the earlier of the completion of the initial business combination and the Company’s liquidation.
The underwriters are entitled to a deferred fee of (i) $0.35 per Unit of the gross proceeds of the initial 22,000,000 Units sold in the initial public offering, or $7,700,000, and (ii) $0.55 per Unit of the gross proceeds from the 3,000,000 Units sold pursuant to the over-allotment option, or $1,650,000, aggregating to a deferred fee of $9,350,000.
We entered into a consulting agreement with a related party, pursuant to which the consultant will provide us, among other services, assistance in finding a potential target for a business combination, as well as supervising and performing due diligence on such targets. We will pay the consultant a fee of $10,000 per month, up to a maximum of $150,000. On May 15, 2020, we amended the consulting agreement whereby the monthly fee was reduced to $7,500, from June 1, 2020 through and including September 2020. The monthly fee reverted back to $10,000 per month on October 1, 2020.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting policies:
Common Stock Subject to Possible Redemption
We account for our Class A common stock subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 480 “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.” Shares of Class A common stock subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability instrument and is measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable common stock (including common stock that features redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders’ equity.
Our Class A common stock features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, the shares of Class A common stock subject to possible redemption is presented as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders’ equity section of our consolidated balance sheets.
Net Income (Loss) per Common Share
We apply the two-class method in calculating earnings per share. Net income per common share, basic and diluted for Class A redeemable common stock is calculated by dividing the interest income earned on the trust account, net of applicable taxes, by the weighted average number of shares of Class A redeemable common stock outstanding for the periods. Net loss per common share, basic and diluted for Class A and Class B non-redeemable common stock is calculated by dividing net income less income attributable to Class A redeemable common stock, by the weighted average number of shares of Class A and Class B non-redeemable common stock outstanding for the periods presented.
Recent Accounting Standards
Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our consolidtaed financial statements.",0

OVERVIEW
Infinium Software, Inc. (""Infinium"" or ""the Company"") develops, markets and supports enterprise-level business software applications and provides software application services. Infinium offers Web-and server-based financial, human resources, supply management, process manufacturing, business analytics and customer relationship management solutions, services, support and deployment options to its customers.
During fiscal year 2001, under the leadership of a new Chief Executive Officer and President hired in February 2001, the Company reassessed its business and established short term goals for fiscal 2001, which included stabilizing the Company, focusing on its core competencies, improving the profitability of the Company and preserving the Company's cash. As a part of these efforts, the Company dramatically reduced the Company's costs in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2001.
During the third quarter, the Company recorded $11.8 million in one-time charges associated with headcount reductions, facilities consolidations, write-offs of certain fixed assets, goodwill and intangible assets. The headcount reductions included 22 percent of the Company's workforce. During the fourth quarter, the Company decided to discontinue its Application Service Provider (""ASP"") business and recorded $7.9 million in charges associated with fixed asset impairment and the costs of disposing this segment. As a result, the accompanying financial statements have been adjusted to reflect the ASP business as a discontinued operation. Also during the fourth quarter, the Company recorded a charge of $1.2 million associated with the restructuring of its AdvaNTage (also known as ""Cort"") Business Unit, including headcount reductions, and write-offs of goodwill and intangibles.
The Company recognizes software license fee revenues in accordance with the provisions of AICPA Statement of Position 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, AICPA Statement of Position 98-9, Modification of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, with Respect to Certain Transactions (SOP 98-9) and their related interpretations. Revenue from software license fees is recognized when there is evidence of an arrangement, the product has been delivered, fees are fixed or determinable, and collection of the related receivable is deemed probable. Revenues from sales of third party products are recorded net of royalties, in accordance with Emerging Issue Task Force 99-19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principle versus Net as an Agent. Generally, the Company's software products do not require significant modification or customization. Installation of the products is normally routine and is not essential to the functionality of the product. The Companies sales frequently include maintenance contracts and professional services with the sale of its software licenses. The Company has established vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (VSOE) for its maintenance contracts and professional services, which is determined based upon the prices charged to customers when these elements are sold separately. Maintenance revenues, including those sold with the initial license fee, are deferred based on VSOE, typically determined by the renewal rate of the annual maintenance contract, and recognized ratably over the maintenance contract period. Consulting and training service revenues, including those sold with license fees, are recognized as the services are performed based on their established VSOE. The amount of revenue allocated to the licenses sold with services and/or maintenance is determined using the ""residual method"" of accounting. Under the residual method, the total value of the arrangement is allocated first to the undelivered elements based on their VSOE with the remainder being allocated to license fees.
Revenues from the Company's Application Services Provider business consist of monthly fees from ongoing services, including hosting, and are recognized daily as earned over the contract term, which is
typically three years. The monthly fee for application services is typically fixed for the life of the contract, but subject to increases in the event a customer requires additional applications, increases its number of users or increases frequency of use. The Company recognizes set-up fees for these arrangements over the expected life of the customer relationship. Recognition of revenue related to these arrangements commences on the date that the customer is able to access and utilize the features and functionality of the applications as intended. In September 2001, the Company decided to discontinue its ASP operations because it did not present an opportunity for timely profitability. As a result, the aforementioned revenues are incorporated within the loss from operations of the ASP segment in the accompanying financials.
YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2001 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2000
REVENUE. Total revenue, exclusive of revenue associated with discontinued operations, decreased 20 percent, from $92.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2000 to $74.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2001. The decrease was due to the reductions in the Company's consulting services and software license fees.
Revenue from continuing operations in North America (United States and Canada) decreased 21 percent, from $84.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2000 to $67.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2001. This is representative of 91 percent of total revenue for both fiscal 2000 and fiscal 2001. EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) revenue decreased 22 percent from $7.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2000 to $5.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2001, which was 8 percent of total revenue for both fiscal 2000 and 2001. Other international regions, including Asia Pacific and Latin America, contributed approximately 1 percent of total revenue for both fiscal 2000 and fiscal 2001.
Software license fee revenue decreased 49 percent, from $20.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2000 to $10.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2001. The Company believes that the decrease was primarily due to the slowdown in technology spending, further complicated by restructuring within the Company.
Service revenue, exclusive of revenue associated with discontinued operations, decreased 12 percent, from $72.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2000 to $63.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2001. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower software license fee revenue. The following table summarizes the composition and decrease in the Company's service revenue:
COST OF SOFTWARE LICENSE FEES. Cost of software license fees consists primarily of amortization expenses related to capitalized software development costs, royalties on the sale of third-party products and the cost of product media, manuals and shipping. Cost of software license fees increased from $7.1 million or 35 percent of software license fees in fiscal 2000, to $8.2 million, or 79 percent of license fees in fiscal 2001. This increase in dollar amount is primarily due to charges of $2.7 million associated with the change in the estimated life of capitalized software and $1.6 million associated with the write-off of purchased software. Excluding these charges, cost of software license fees decreased 46 percent and approximates the reduction in software license fees.
COST OF SERVICES. Cost of services consists of costs to provide support, implementation, consulting and training services to licensees. Cost of services, exclusive of costs associated with discontinued operations in fiscal 2001 and product lines discontinued in fiscal 2000 ($1.9 million), decreased 35 percent from $29.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2000 to $19.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2001. Cost of services as a percentage of service revenue decreased from 41 percent for the year ended
September 30, 2000 to 30 percent for the year ended September 30, 2001. The decrease is due to lower third-party consulting expenses and lower internal consulting expenses associated with reduced headcount.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. Research and development expenses consists primarily of engineering personnel costs, contractor costs, and related facilities and computers and communications overhead, reduced by capitalized software development costs and research funding. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the relationship between the Company's research and development expenses as recorded on its consolidated statements of operations and its total research and development spending:
Research and development expenses, exclusive of costs associated with discontinued operations, was $21.3 million and $16.2 million for the years ended September 30, 2000 and 2001, respectively. Research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenue was 23 percent for the year ended September 30, 2000 and 22 percent for the year ended September 30, 2001. The Company capitalized $1.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2000 and $2.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2001. Additionally, research and development spending decreased 19 percent from $22.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2000 to $18.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2001. Reductions are primarily associated with reduced headcount. The Company continues to make investments in research and development.
SALES AND MARKETING. Sales and marketing expenses consists primarily of salaries, commissions, travel, promotional expenses, facilities, and computers and communications overhead costs associated with the Company's sales and marketing efforts. Sales and marketing expenses, exclusive of expenses associated with discontinued operations, decreased 25 percent from $36.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2000 to $27.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2001. Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased from 39 percent for the year ended September 30, 2000 to 37 percent for the year ended September 30, 2001. The decrease in expenses as both a dollar amount and percentage was primarily due to lower sales costs from headcount reductions as well as lower marketing costs as a result of the company-wide emphasis on cost reduction in fiscal year 2001.
GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE. General and administrative expenses consists primarily of compensation for executive and administrative personnel, associated facilities, computers and communications overhead, provision for doubtful accounts, amortization of intangible assets, insurance, and outside professional fees. General and administrative expenses, exclusive of expenses associated with discontinued operations, increased 5 percent, from $15.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2000 to $16.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2001. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased from 17 percent for the year ended September 30, 2000 to 22 percent for the year ended September 30, 2001. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to one-time charges of $6.5 million comprised of the following: $3.9 million associated with the write-off of goodwill and intangibles, $1.6 million associated with the write-off of fixed assets, and lease obligations and $1.0 million associated with the Company's reduction in force and executive terminations. Non-recurring expenses included in general and administrative expenses amounted to $2.2 million during fiscal year 2000. Excluding these one-time charges associated with each fiscal year, general and administrative expenses decreased 26 percent from $13.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2000 to $9.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2001. The decrease is due to cost savings associated with the Company's reduced headcount and overall cost-cutting measures. Excluding these charges, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased from 14 percent for the year ended September 30, 2000, to 13 percent for the year ended September 30, 2001. As a result of the write-off of goodwill, the Company expects lower future general and administrative expenses.
OTHER INCOME, NET. Other income, net consists of interest income, interest expenses, foreign currency exchange gains and losses, marketable equity securities gains and losses and a legal settlement. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 the Company recorded a $4.9 million gain associated with a legal settlement in defense of the Company's intellectual property. Other income, net decreased from $6.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2000 to $22,000 for the year ended September 30, 2001. The decrease was primarily attributed to the settlement noted above, lower interest income due to lower cash, lower rates of return available in the market, and marketable securities balances available for investment and foreign exchange losses. Additionally, the Company recorded a charge of $331 thousand to reflect the other than temporary decline in fair value of one of these equity investments below its initial cost basis.
PROVISION FOR (BENEFIT FROM) INCOME TAXES. The provision for (benefit from) federal, state and foreign income taxes was $6.9 million and ($2.3) million for the years ended September 30, 2000 and 2001, respectively. The tax benefit recognized for 2001 was primarily a result of the favorable resolution of potential tax liabilities and the release of reserves as a result of increased net operating losses. During fiscal year 2000, the Company established a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets which resulted in a $14.0 million charge and was primarily responsible for the provision (See Notes 2 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements).
DISCONTINUED APPLICATION SERVICE PROVIDER BUSINESS. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2001, the Company decided to discontinue its ASP business unit. The Company recorded a charge of $1.8 million associated with the disposal of the ASP segment. Additionally, the Company realized operating losses from its discontinued ASP business of $8.1 million and $11.7 million for the years ended September 30, 2000 and 2001, respectively. Included in the loss from operations of the discontinued segment is a $6.1 million charge for the write-off of unrecoverable fixed asset balances.
YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2000 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1999
REVENUE. Total revenue, exclusive of revenue associated with discontinued operations, decreased 24 percent, from $122.0 million for the year ended September 30, 1999 to $92.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2000. The decrease was due to the reductions in the Company's consulting services and software license fees.
Revenue from continuing operations in North America (United States and Canada) decreased 26 percent, from $113.5 million for the year ended September 30, 1999 to $84.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2000. This is representative of 93 percent and 91 percent of total revenue for fiscal 1999 and fiscal 2000, respectively. EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) revenue decreased 12 percent from $8.2 million for the year ended September 30, 1999 to $7.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2000, which was 7 percent and 8 percent of total revenue for fiscal 1999 and 2000, respectively. Other international regions, including Asia Pacific and Latin America, contributed approximately 1 percent of total revenue for both fiscal 1999 and 2000.
Software license fee revenue decreased 37 percent, from $32.4 million for the year ended September 30, 1999 to $20.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2000. The Company believes that the decrease was primarily due to the elimination of revenues related to discontinued products, potential customers deciding to postpone software acquisitions to focus on their Year 2000 compliance issues in the first quarter of fiscal 2000 and the subsequent slow recovery in the market for the licensing of back office applications.
Service revenue, exclusive of revenue associated with discontinued operations, decreased 19 percent, from $89.6 million for the year ended September 30, 1999 to $72.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2000. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower software license fee revenue and elimination of Year 2000
consulting services after the first quarter of 2000. The following table summarizes the composition and decrease in the Company's service revenue:
COST OF SOFTWARE LICENSE FEES. Cost of software license fees consists primarily of amortization expenses related to capitalized software development costs, royalties on the sale of third-party products and the cost of product media, manuals and shipping. Cost of license fees decreased from $14.5 million or 45 percent of software license fees in fiscal 1999, to $7.1 million, or 35 percent of license fees in fiscal 2000. Excluding the 1999 charges related to product discontinuance of $6.3 million (which includes $5.6 million related to the write-off of capitalized purchased software and $700 thousand related to the write-off of prepaid royalties for third-party products sold with the discontinued product line), cost of software license fees decreased 13 percent from $8.2 million for the year ended September 30, 1999 to $7.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2000. Exclusive of the changes related to product discontinuances in fiscal 1999, cost of software license fees as a percentage of software license fee revenue increased from 25 percent for the year ended September 30, 1999 to 35 percent for the year ended September 30, 2000. The decrease of such costs resulted primarily from the elimination of amortization of capitalized software costs related to a discontinued product during fiscal 1999. The increase as a percentage of license fee revenues was due to a decrease in software license fees and an increase in third-party royalty fees.
COST OF SERVICES. Cost of services consists of costs to provide support, implementation, consulting and training services to licensees. Cost of services, exclusive of cost associated with discontinued operations, decreased 22 percent from $40.4 million for the year ended September 30, 1999 to $31.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2000. Cost of services as a percentage of service revenue decreased from 45 percent for the year ended September 30, 1999 to 44 percent for the year ended September 30, 2000. The decrease is primarily due to lower third-party consulting fees.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. Research and development expenses consists primarily of engineering personnel costs, contractor costs, and related facilities and computers and communications overhead, reduced by capitalized software development costs and research funding. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the relationship between the Company's research and development expenses as recorded on its consolidated statements of operations and its total research and development spending:
Research and development expenses, exclusive of expenses associated with discontinued operations, was $19.1 million and $21.3 million for the years ended September 30, 1999 and 2000, respectively. Research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenue was 16 percent for the year ended September 30, 1999 and 23 percent for the year ended September 30, 2000. The Company capitalized $5.8 million for the year ended September 30, 1999 and $1.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2000. Additionally, research and development spending decreased 8 percent from $24.9 million for the year ended September 30, 1999 to $22.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2000. For the year ended September 30, 2000, research and
development expenses associated with discontinued product lines was $2.1 million. The Company continues to make significant investments in research and development. The Company believes that development spending is critical to building long-term product and technology advantages in the market.
SALES AND MARKETING. Sales and marketing expenses consists primarily of salaries, commissions, travel, promotional expenses, facilities, and computers and communications overhead costs. Sales and marketing expenses, exclusive of expenses associated with discontinued operations, decreased 10 percent from $40.1 million for the year ended September 30, 1999 to $36.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2000. Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased from 33 percent for the year ended September 30, 1999 to 39 percent for the year ended September 30, 2000. The decrease expense was primarily due to reduced commissions resulting from lower sales levels. These costs were partially offset by increased investments in the Company's corporate image and brand awareness marketing which resulted in the increase as a percentage of overall revenue.
GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE. General and administrative expenses consists primarily of compensation for executive and administrative personnel, associated facilities, computers and communications overhead, provision for doubtful accounts, amortization of intangible assets, insurance, outside professional fees, and a portion of the expenses incurred related to the Company's discontinued product lines. General and administrative expenses, exclusive of expenses associated with discontinued operations, increased 8 percent, from $14.5 million for the year ended September 30, 1999 to $15.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2000. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased from 12 percent for the year ended September 30, 1999 to 17 percent for the year ended September 30, 2000. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to costs associated with the Company's increasing focus on its new customer relationship management line of business, as well as the expenses incurred in connection with the discontinued product lines. In addition, during the third quarter of fiscal 2000, general and administrative expenses included costs associated with employee attendance at Infinium World, the Company's annual customer conference.
WRITE-OFF OF DISCONTINUED PRODUCT LINES. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1999, the Company decided to discontinue new release development of Infinium Financials and Infinium Human Resources for Microsoft Windows NT. The Company had agreed to provide maintenance and consulting services for existing customers until November 2000. Of the $9.5 million of estimated costs related to these actions, $2.3 million is related to impaired receivables, $5.6 million relates to the write-off of capitalized and purchased software, $900 thousand is related to the write-off of goodwill associated with the Company's acquisition of Time Open Systems Limited, and $700 thousand is related to the write-off of prepaid royalties for third-party products sold with the discontinued product lines.
In fiscal year 2000, the Company realized operating losses from its discontinued product line of $5.7 million. Operating expenses of $6.2 million was incurred to provide maintenance and support, to transition customers to alternative software platforms and to resolve disputes. Expenses recorded in cost of service, research and development, and general and administrative were $1.9 million, $2.1 million, and $2.2 million, respectively.
OTHER INCOME, NET. Other income, net consists of interest income, interest expense, foreign exchange gains and losses, marketable equity securities gains and losses and a legal settlement. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 the Company recorded a $4.9 million gain associated with a legal settlement in defense of the Company's intellectual property. Other income, net increased 132 percent from $2.6 million for the year ended September 30, 1999 to $6.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2000. The increase was primarily attributed to the settlement noted above.
PROVISION FOR (BENEFIT FROM) INCOME TAXES. The provision for (benefit from) federal, state and foreign income taxes was ($1.7) million and $6.9 million for the years ended September 30, 1999 and 2000, respectively. The tax benefit realized during fiscal year 1999 was attributed to the charge to operations of $9.5 million for the write-off of discontinued product lines. The effective tax rate was (42 percent) for the year ended September 30, 1999 and 33 percent for the year ended September 30, 2000. During the fourth quarter
the Company established a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets which resulted in a $14.0 million charge (See Notes 2 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements).
DISCONTINUED ASP BUSINESS. The results of operations for the discontinued ASP business for fiscal year 2000 have been stated separately on the consolidated statement of operations for comparative purposes.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
As of September 30, 2001, the Company had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $15.3 million, resulting from a net use of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $5.5 million during fiscal year 2001. Operating activities consumed $1.7 million and included $5.8 million used in discontinued operations. The net loss, which includes an $11.7 million operating loss associated with the ASP business unit, and a $1.8 million estimated loss from the disposal of the discontinued operations, totaled $24.3 million. Investing activities consumed $2.9 million and included $2.3 million used to fund capitalized software, and $700 thousand used to fund purchases of property, computers and equipment. Financing activities consumed $61 thousand. Proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the employee stock purchase plan provided $104 thousand, offset by $143 thousand of payments on capital lease obligations and $22 thousand paid to purchase treasury stock. In October 2001 the Company entered into a line of credit with a financial institution under which it can borrow up to $3.0 million, based on certain asset-based balances. The agreement, which extends to December 31, 2002, contains certain financial covenants including a prohibition against the payment of dividends, as well as, minimum net deficit targets ranging from $19 million in 2001 to $10 million in May 2002. The Company has not borrowed under this line of credit. The interest rate on any funds that are borrowed would be at prime plus 1 percent.
Days sales outstanding (""DSO"") decreased to 36 days at September 30, 2001, compared to 58 days at September 30, 2000. The Company calculates DSO by dividing the ending accounts receivable balance, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, by the annualized revenue for the most recent fiscal quarter, multiplied by 360. The Company believes that this method of deriving DSO is indicative of actual results due to the cyclical nature of software license and service transactions, which are often consummated near the end of the quarter, as well as the fluctuation of transactions from one quarter to the next. The Company's accounts receivable balance at September 30, 2001, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts, was $6.8 million. This compares with $16.2 million as of September 30, 2000.
Deferred revenue decreased $7.7 million, from $36.7 million at September 30, 2000, to $29.0 million at September 30, 2001. The decrease in deferred revenue primarily resulted from a decrease in the deferred consulting services component of revenue.
The Company has incurred net operating losses in each of the last three fiscal years ended September 2001, 2000 and 1999, and generated a negative cash flow from operations in each of the last two years. In addition, software license fee sales and services revenues have decreased in each of the last three fiscal years. As of September 30, 2001, the Company had a working capital deficit of $21.2 million and a retained deficit of $12.7 million. Included in the working capital deficit is $27.6 million of deferred revenue. During fiscal year 2001, under the leadership of a new Chief Executive Officer and President hired in February 2001, the Company reassessed its business and established short term goals for fiscal 2001, which included stabilizing the Company, focusing on its core competencies, improving the profitability of the Company and preserving the Company's cash. As a part of these efforts, the Company significantly reduced the Company's costs in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2001. As part of its cost reduction efforts, in September 2001, due to continued historical operating losses from its Application Service Provider (""ASP"") business segment and because the ASP did not present an opportunity for timely profitability, the Company's management decided to discontinue the ASP by phasing out of the business segment over a period of six months. As a result, this business segment is classified as a discontinued operation in the consolidated statement of operations. During fiscal 2001, the Company also reduced its headcount by 36 percent. The Company believes that it has sufficient cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand to fund its operations through at least fiscal 2002.
While operating activities may provide cash in certain periods, to the extent the Company anticipates growth in the future, the Company anticipates that its operating and investing activities may use cash, and, consequently, such growth may require the Company to obtain additional sources of financing.
The Company's working capital and other capital requirements may change because of unanticipated changes in business conditions or delays in market acceptance of new products. Other considerations such as further expansion of operations or research and development activities, competitive and technological developments, and possible future acquisitions of businesses and/or product rights may also affect the Company's capital requirements. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to raise sufficient debt or equity capital on terms that it considers acceptable, if at all. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Company may not experience liquidity problems as a result or because of adverse market conditions or other unfavorable events.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (""SFAS No. 141""), Business Combinations. SFAS No. 141 requires the use of the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 and eliminates the pooling-of-interests method. The Company adopted SFAS No. 141 which would apply to any future acquisitions entered into by the Company.
In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 (SFAS No. 142), Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least annually. In addition, the standard includes provisions for the reclassification of certain existing intangibles as goodwill and reassessment of the useful lives of existing intangibles. The Company plans to adopt SFAS No. 142 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2002 and does not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on its financial statements as the Company has no goodwill or intangible assets related to prior acquisitions.
In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets (SFAS 144). SFAS 144 supercedes SFAS 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets",0

Overview and Executive Summary
Keysight Technologies, Inc. (""we,"" ""us,"" ""Keysight"" or the ""company""), incorporated in Delaware on December 6, 2013, is a technology company that helps enterprises, service providers and governments accelerate innovation to connect and secure the world by providing electronic design and test solutions that are used in the simulation, design, validation, manufacture, installation, optimization and secure operation of electronics systems in the communications, networking and electronics industries. We also offer customization, consulting and optimization services throughout the customer's product lifecycle, including start-up assistance, asset management, up-time services, application services and instrument calibration and repair.
Our fiscal year end is October 31. Unless otherwise stated, all years and dates refer to our fiscal year.
We completed an organizational change in 2020 to manage our former Ixia Solutions Group within our Communications Solutions Group to enable us to create improved go-to market and product development alignment as well as accelerate solution synergies as new technologies emerge. As a result of this organizational change, we now have two reportable operating segments, the Communications Solutions Group and the Electronic Industrial Solutions Group. Prior period segment results were revised to conform to the current presentation.
Impact of COVID-19 pandemic and outlook
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic. In response to the rapid global spread of the virus, national, state, and local governments issued orders and recommendations to attempt to reduce the further spread of the disease. Such orders included movement control and shelter-in-place orders, travel restrictions, limitations on public gatherings, school closures, social distancing requirements and the closure of all but critical and essential services and infrastructure. In response to these measures and to protect the health and safety of our employees, we temporarily closed our locations globally, including our production and order fulfillment facilities, asked all employees who can work from home to do so for the foreseeable future, made substantial changes to employee travel policies, and canceled training and marketing events or moved them to a virtual format. Our customers, suppliers and vendors have been subject to these restrictions and orders and have been similarly impacted. Fluctuation in infection rates in the regions in which we operate have resulted in periodic changes in restrictions that vary from region to region and require vigilant attention and rapid response to new or reinstated restrictions.
Working with local governments and health officials to implement health and safety measures at all of our locations, we have re-opened many sites worldwide and significantly ramped our production and services operations, despite the ongoing broader industry supply chain challenges. We have restarted on-site operations using only employees who are not able to work effectively from home and where doing so is in compliance with local regulations and our COVID-19 safety procedures. We continue to make significant investment in research and development (""R&D"") and have taken necessary steps to sustain employee productivity and deliver on our customer commitments, particularly those who provide essential services, and support the communities in which we operate around the world. Also, given the uncertainty of the duration or severity of the pandemic, we took proactive measures to reduce costs and preserve liquidity, while supporting our customers and advancing key projects. These measures included a temporary hiring freeze and a reduction in other discretionary spending, along with reductions in variable compensation and outsourced manufacturing costs enabled by our flexible cost structure.
Our revenue for 2020 was lower when compared to 2019 due to site closures and supply chain disruptions resulting from the temporary shutdown of our production facilities related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of lower revenue on gross margin and operating margin was more than offset by favorable mix and lower discretionary spending as a result of our mitigation efforts. We continue to see steady demand across several end markets, with on-going investment in next-generation technologies, such as 5G, 400G and advanced semiconductor node processes, while demand decreased in other markets, such as automotive and energy.
Our strategy of bringing first-to-market solutions that help customers develop new technologies and accelerate innovation provides a platform for long-term growth. We expect our customers to continue to make R&D investments in certain next-generation technologies. We are still in the early market stages for emerging technologies, such as 5G, next-generation automotive, internet of things (""IoT"") and defense modernization and expect technology investments to continue. We continue to closely monitor the current macro environment related to trade, tariffs, monetary and fiscal policies, as well as pandemics or epidemics, such as the recent COVID-19 outbreak. We have complied and will continue to comply with recent U.S. Department of Commerce export control regulations. While we expect ongoing COVID-19 demand and supply chain headwinds over the next few quarters, we remain confident in our long-term secular market growth trends and the strength of our operating model.
For discussion of risks related to COVID-19 on our operations, business results and financial condition, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Years ended October 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018
Total orders for 2020 were $4,528 million, an increase of 2 percent when compared to 2019. Foreign currency movements had an immaterial impact on the year-over-year comparison. Orders associated with acquisitions contributed 1 percent to the order growth for 2020 when compared to 2019. Order growth in Asia Pacific was partially offset by a decline in Europe, while the Americas remained flat. Total orders for 2019 were $4,441 million, an increase of 9 percent when compared to 2018. Foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of 1 percentage point on the year-over-year comparison. Orders associated with acquisitions and divestitures had a net neutral impact on the order growth for 2019 when compared to 2018. Order growth in Asia Pacific and the Americas was partially offset by a decline in Europe.
Revenue of $4,221 million for 2020 decreased 2 percent when compared to 2019. Foreign currency movements had an immaterial impact on the year-over-year comparison. Revenue associated with acquisitions had a 1 percent favorable impact on revenue for 2020 when compared to 2019. Revenue for both the Electronic Industrial Solutions Group and the Communications Solutions Group declined year over year due to the impact of site closures and supply chain disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Revenue from the Communications Solutions Group and the Electronic Industrial Solutions Group represented approximately 74 percent and 26 percent, respectively, of total revenue for 2020. Revenue of $4,303 million for 2019 increased 11 percent when compared to 2018. Foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of 1 percentage point on the year-over-year comparison. Revenue associated with acquisitions and divestitures had a net neutral impact on the revenue growth for 2019 when compared to 2018. Revenue grew in both the Communications Solutions Group and the Electronic Industrial Solutions Group, with commercial communications leading the growth. Revenue from the Communications Solutions Group and the Electronic Industrial Solutions Group represented approximately 74 percent and 26 percent, respectively, of total revenue for 2019.
Net income was $627 million in 2020 compared to net income of $621 million and $165 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in net income for 2020 when compared to 2019 was driven by favorable mix, a decline in variable compensation and a reduction in discretionary spending, partially offset by lower revenue volume due to the impact of site closures and supply chain disruptions as well as higher income tax expense. The increase in net income for 2019 when compared to 2018 was driven by a non-recurring goodwill impairment charge in 2018, higher revenue volume, highly differentiated solutions, favorable mix, and lower acquisition and integration costs, partially offset by a favorable income tax benefit in the prior period from U.S. tax legislation, and higher R&D investments in leading-edge technologies and key growth opportunities in our end markets. In 2020, 2019 and 2018, we generated operating cash flows of $1,016 million, $998 million and $555 million, respectively.
In 2020, we recognized an operating gain of $32 million as a result of a final insurance settlement of $37 million for replacement of capital and recovery of expenses associated with the 2017 northern California wildfires. In 2019 and 2018, we recognized operating expenses of $3 million and $7 million, respectively, net of expected insurance recoveries, and received insurance proceeds of $22 million and $68 million, respectively.
Currency Exchange Rate Exposure
Our revenues, costs and expenses, and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities. We hedge revenues, expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short-term and anticipated basis. The result of the hedging has been included in our consolidated statement of operations. We experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of operations because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues, expenses, monetary assets and liabilities. Our hedging program is designed to hedge short-term currency movements based on a rolling period of up to twelve months. Therefore, we are exposed to currency fluctuations over the longer term. To the extent that we are required to pay for all, or portions, of an acquisition price in foreign currencies, we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the U.S. dollar cost of the transaction.
Results from Operations - Years ended October 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018
Revenue
Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of the promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. Returns are recorded in the period received from the customer and historically have not been material.
The following table provides the percent change in revenue for the years ended October 31, 2020 and 2019 by geographic region, including and excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, as compared to the respective prior year.
For the year ended October 31, 2020, revenue declined in the Americas and Europe, partially offset by growth in Asia Pacific, due to the impact of temporary site closures and supply chain disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Foreign currency movements had an immaterial impact on the revenue decline for 2020. Foreign currency movements had a favorable impact of 1 percentage point on revenue in Europe 2020.
For the year ended October 31, 2019, revenue increased in Asia Pacific and the Americas, partially offset by a decline in Europe. Foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of 1 percentage point on the revenue increase for 2019. Foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of 3 percentage points and 1 percentage point on revenue in Europe and Asia Pacific, respectively, for 2019.
Backlog
Backlog represents the amount of revenue expected from orders that have already been booked, including orders for goods and services that have not been delivered to customers, orders invoiced but not yet recognized as revenue, and orders for goods that were shipped but not invoiced, awaiting acceptance by customers and/or completion of a commitment to a customer. At October 31, 2020, our unfilled backlog was approximately $1,709 million as compared to approximately $1,380 million at October 31, 2019. Consistent with our strategy, we are seeing an increase in solution sales, which have a longer order-to-revenue conversion cycle; however, we expect that the majority of unfilled backlog will be recognized as revenue within six months. While backlog on any date can be an indicator of short-term revenue performance, it is not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or long-term revenue performance.
Costs and Expenses
Gross margin increased 1 percentage point in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily driven by favorable mix and lower variable compensation, partially offset by lower revenue volume due to the impact of site closures and supply chain disruptions. Gross margin increased 5 percentage points in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily driven by higher revenue volume, highly differentiated solutions, favorable mix and a decline in warranty costs.
Excess and obsolete inventory charges were $29 million in 2020, $27 million in 2019 and $25 million in 2018. Sales of previously written-down inventory were $2 million in each of 2020, 2019 and 2018.
Research and development expense increased 4 percent in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily driven by greater investments in key growth opportunities in our end markets and leading-edge technologies, and incremental costs of acquired businesses, partially offset by declines in variable compensation and a reduction in discretionary spending due to COVID-19 related restrictions. Research and development expense increased 10 percent in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily driven by greater investments in key growth opportunities in our end markets, leading-edge technologies, people and infrastructure. Research and development expense as a percent of total revenue was 17 percent in 2020 and 16 percent in each of 2019 and 2018.
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 5 percent in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily driven by declines in travel and marketing-related costs due to COVID-19 related restrictions, and variable and other people-related costs, partially offset by incremental costs of acquired businesses. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 4 percent in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily driven by declines in litigation, restructuring, and acquisition and integration costs, partially offset by an increase in people-related costs.
In 2018 we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $709 million related to the Ixia acquisition based on the results of our annual impairment test of goodwill. See Note 11, ""Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,"" to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Other operating expense (income), net was income of $44 million, $20 million and $33 million for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Other operating expense (income), net for 2020 includes a gain of $32 million due to a final insurance settlement related to damage from the 2017 northern California wildfires. Other operating expense (income), net for 2018 also includes income from business divestitures.
Operating margin increased 2 percentage points in 2020 when compared to 2019, primarily driven by favorable revenue mix, declines in travel and marketing-related costs due to COVID-19 related restrictions, and variable compensation, partially offset
by lower revenue volume. Operating margin increased 27 percentage points in 2019 when compared to 2018, primarily driven by a non-recurring goodwill impairment charge in 2018, higher revenue volume, highly differentiated solutions, favorable mix, lower acquisition and integration costs, and lower litigation and restructuring-related costs, partially offset by an increase in people-related costs.
Our headcount was approximately 13,900 at October 31, 2020 compared to 13,600 at October 31, 2019. The increase in headcount was primarily driven by acquisitions.
Interest Income and Expense
Interest income for 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $11 million, $23 million and $12 million, respectively, and primarily relates to interest earned on our cash balances. Interest expense for 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $78 million, $80 million and $83 million, respectively, and primarily relates to interest on our senior notes.
Other income (expense), net
Other income (expense), net for 2020, 2019 and 2018 was income of $63 million, $61 million and $54 million, respectively, and primarily includes income related to our defined benefit and post-retirement benefit plans (interest cost, expected return on assets and amortization of net actuarial loss and prior service credits) and the change in fair value of our equity investments. We also recognized gains from insurance proceeds of $9 million and $15 million for the years ended October 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Income Taxes
For 2020, the effective tax rate was 18 percent, which is lower than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to a higher percentage of earnings in the non-U.S. jurisdictions taxed at lower statutory tax rates.
For 2019, the effective tax rate was 13 percent, which is lower than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to a higher percentage of earnings in the non-U.S. jurisdictions taxed at lower statutory tax rates. The increase in the effective tax rate from 2019 to 2020 is primarily due to a one-time rate benefit from a release of tax reserves in 2019 and an increase in 2020 of taxes in non-U.S. jurisdictions due to acquired entity integration offset by a decrease in U.S. taxes on non-U.S. earnings.
For 2018, the effective tax rate was 140 percent, which is higher than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the net impact of U.S. tax law changes, the Singapore restructuring and tax incentive modifications completed in 2018 in response to Singapore tax law changes, and the tax impact of goodwill impairment.
Keysight benefits from tax incentives in several jurisdictions, most significantly in Singapore, that have granted us tax incentives that require renewal at various times in the future. The tax incentives provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income in those jurisdictions. The Singapore tax incentives are due for renewal in 2024. The incentive in Malaysia was due for renewal in 2020 for the period from 2021 to 2025. Keysight has received confirmation from the Malaysian Investment Development Authority that this incentive will be renewed for the period from 2021 to 2025. The impact of the tax incentives decreased income taxes by $53 million, $47 million and $567 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in the tax benefit from 2018 to 2019 is primarily due to the one-time impacts of the Singapore restructuring and tax incentive modifications that were completed in 2018 in response to Singapore tax law changes.
The calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. Although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model, the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management. In accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, for all U.S. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. The ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated, which could result in a material impact on income tax expense. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. If the payment of these additional amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the
period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations. Accrued interest and penalties are included on the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheet.
The open tax years for the IRS and most states are from November 1, 2015 through the current tax year. Keysight’s 2018 U.S. federal income tax return is currently under audit by the IRS. This is the year in which the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted and the one-time U.S. tax on earnings not previously repatriated to the U.S., known as the Transition Tax, was reported. For the majority of our foreign entities, the open tax years are from November 1, 2015 through the current tax year. For certain foreign entities, the tax years remain open, at most, back to the year 2008. Given the number of years and numerous matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions, we are unable to estimate the range of possible changes to the balance of our unrecognized tax benefits.
The company is being audited in Malaysia for the 2008 tax year. This tax year pre-dates our separation from Agilent (the ""Separation""). However, pursuant to the agreement between Agilent and Keysight pertaining to tax matters, as finalized at the time of the Separation, for certain entities, including Malaysia, any historical tax liability is the responsibility of Keysight. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, Keysight paid income taxes and penalties of $68 million on gains related to intellectual property rights. Our appeal to the Special Commissioners of Income Tax in Malaysia was unsuccessful. An appeal has now been lodged with the High Court of Malaysia. The company believes there are numerous defenses to the current assessment; the statute of limitations for the 2008 tax year in Malaysia was closed, and the income in question is exempt from tax in Malaysia. The company is disputing this assessment and pursuing all avenues to resolve this issue favorably for the company.
Segment Overview
We completed an organizational change in 2020 to manage our former Ixia Solutions Group within our Communications Solutions Group to enable us to create improved go-to market and product development alignment as well as accelerate solution synergies as new technologies emerge. As a result of this organizational change, we now have two reportable operating segments, the Communications Solutions Group and the Electronic Industrial Solutions Group. Prior period segment results have been revised to conform to the current presentation.
The profitability of each of the segments is measured after excluding share-based compensation expense, restructuring and related costs, amortization of acquisition-related balances, acquisition and integration costs, pension curtailment and settlement loss (gain), Northern California wildfire-related impacts, goodwill impairment, legal settlement, gain on divestitures, interest income, interest expense and other items.
Communications Solutions Group
The Communications Solutions Group serves customers spanning the worldwide commercial communications and aerospace, defense and government end markets. The group's solutions consist of electronic design and test software, electronic measurement instruments, systems and related services. These solutions are used in the simulation, design, validation, manufacturing, installation and optimization of electronic equipment and networks. Prior period amounts have been revised to conform to our new organizational structure described previously in the Segment Overview.
Revenue
Communications Solutions Group revenue for 2020 decreased 1 percent when compared to 2019 and declined 2 percent excluding the impact of acquisitions. Revenue declined in the aerospace, defense and government market, while remaining flat in the commercial communications market, primarily driven by temporary site closures and supply chain disruptions due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. For 2020, foreign currency movements had an immaterial impact on revenue. Revenue decline in the Americas and Europe was partially offset by growth in Asia Pacific. Communications Solutions Group revenue in 2019 increased 12 percent when compared to 2018, and increased 12 percent excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures. Revenue increased due to strong growth in the commercial communications market, while the aerospace, defense and government market was flat. For 2019, foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of 1 percentage point on revenue. Revenue growth in Asia Pacific and the Americas was partially offset by a decline in Europe.
Revenue from the commercial communications market represented approximately 70 percent of total Communications Solutions Group revenue in 2020 and was flat year over year, with growth in Asia Pacific offset by declines in the Americas and
Europe. In 2020 revenue remained flat, primarily driven by continued investments in 5G across the design lifecycle from development to deployment, offset by COVID-19 related site closures and supply chain disruptions. We continue to see investments in 5G, fueled by the ongoing redesign of every aspect of communications systems, including wireless access, infrastructure, wireline technologies, data centers and the cloud. Revenue from the commercial communications market represented approximately 69 percent of total Communications Solutions Group revenue in 2019 and increased 18 percent year over year, with growth in Asia Pacific and the Americas, partially offset by a decline in Europe. In 2019 revenue growth was primarily driven by increased 5G investment across the wireless ecosystem and growth in data-center-related next-generation 400 gigabit Ethernet and higher digital test.
Revenue from the aerospace, defense and government market represented approximately 30 percent of total Communications Solutions Group revenue in 2020 and declined 5 percent year over year, with revenue declining across all regions. The revenue decline was primarily driven by COVID-19 related site closures and supply chain disruptions, and by lower investment in Europe and Asia. We continue to see strength for our electromagnetic spectrum threat simulation platform, as well as solutions for radar, space, satellite and 5G. Revenue from the aerospace, defense and government market represented approximately 31 percent of total Communications Solutions Group revenue in 2019 and was flat when compared to 2018. In 2019 revenue grew in the Americas and Asia Pacific, partially offset by a decline in Europe.
Gross Margin and Operating Margin
The following table provides Communications Solutions Group margins, expenses and income from operations for 2020 versus 2019, and 2019 versus 2018.
Gross margin for the Communications Solutions Group in 2020 increased 1 percentage point compared to 2019, primarily driven by favorable revenue mix and highly differentiated solutions, partially offset by lower revenue volume due to COVID-19 related site closures and supply chain disruptions. Gross margin for the Communications Solutions Group in 2019 increased 3 percentage points compared to 2018, primarily driven by higher revenue volume, highly differentiated solutions, favorable mix and lower warranty costs, partially offset by increases in infrastructure-related costs.
Research and development expense in 2020 increased 4 percent when compared to 2019, primarily driven by greater investment in key growth opportunities in our end markets and leading-edge technologies, incremental costs of acquired businesses and increases in infrastructure-related costs, partially offset by declines in variable compensation and travel costs due to COVID-19 related restrictions. Research and development expense in 2019 increased 10 percent when compared to 2018, driven by greater investments in key growth opportunities in our end markets, leading-edge technologies, infrastructure and people.
Selling, general and administrative expense in 2020 decreased 5 percent when compared to 2019, driven by declines in variable compensation and a reduction in discretionary spending due to COVID-19 related restrictions, lower infrastructure-related costs and lower marketing costs, partially offset by incremental costs of acquired businesses. Selling, general and administrative expense in 2019 was flat when compared to 2018, as higher marketing-related investments were offset by declines in selling costs.
Other operating expense (income), net primarily includes property rental income and was income of $9 million in 2020, $11 million in 2019 and $9 million in 2018.
Income from Operations
Income from operations for 2020 increased $30 million on a corresponding revenue decline of $45 million. Income from operations for 2019 increased $253 million on corresponding revenue growth of $334 million.
Operating margin in 2020 increased 1 percentage point when compared to 2019, driven by favorable mix and highly differentiated solutions, while selling, general and administrative expense declined. Operating margin in 2019 increased 6 percentage points when compared to 2018, driven by higher revenue volume, highly differentiated solutions, cost synergies resulting from the Ixia integration and favorable mix, while selling, general and administrative expense was flat.
Electronic Industrial Solutions Group
The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group provides test and measurement solutions and related services across a broad set of electronic industrial end markets, focusing on high-value applications in the automotive and energy industry and measurement solutions for consumer electronics, education, general electronics design and manufacturing, and semiconductor design and manufacturing. The group provides electronic design and test software, electronic measurement instruments and systems and related services used in the simulation, design, validation, manufacturing, installation and optimization of electronic equipment.

"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis contains a number of ""forward looking"" statements within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Such factors include, among others, the following: international, national and local political, economic and market conditions; incremental costs, slowed automobile production or other effects that may occur as a result of the September 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon or reactions thereto by us or our suppliers and customers; possible future terrorist attacks; demographic changes; the size and growth of the automobile market or the plastic automobile component market; our ability to sustain, manage or forecast our growth; the size, timing and mix of purchases of our products; our ability to realize savings from our focus on reducing and controlling costs; our ability to realize the benefits of general tax reduction plans; new product development and introduction; existing government regulations and changes in, or the failure to comply with, government regulations; adverse publicity; dependence upon original equipment manufacturers; liability and other claims asserted against us; competition; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results; unfavorable currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar; changes in business strategy or development plans; business disruptions; product recalls; warranty costs; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; the ability to protect technology; retention of earnings; control and the level of affiliated transactions.
On May 28, 1999, we acquired Peguform GmbH, a leading international designer and manufacturer of complete interior modules, door panels and dashboards and of exterior modules and other structural plastic body parts, including bumper fascias and hatchback doors.
The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales. This table and the subsequent discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein.
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000
Net sales increased $32.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, or 1.8 %, to $1,862.3 million, compared to net sales of $1,829.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Foreign sales increased $85.1 million or 6.8% due to higher tooling sales, increased volume and more content per vehicle. This increase was offset by a decrease of 2.8% in the average currency exchange rate between fiscal years 2000 and 2001, which resulted in a reduction in foreign sales of approximately $3.8 million. Domestically, sales decreased $49.5 million, or 8.5%, due to a general softening of the North American automotive market. Included in net sales is $8.5 million recovered from an OEM due to program delays incurred in 2000 and 2001 at our foreign operations.
Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased $1.6 million, or .7 %, to $229.2 million compared to $227.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit decreased from 12.4% for the year ended December 31, 2000 to 12.3 % for the year ended December 31, 2001. Domestically, gross profit as a percent of sales was 12.5% as the result of the implementation of lean manufacturing techniques despite the decrease in sales, compared to 9.8% for the year ended December 31, 2000. Internationally, gross profit as a percent of sales was 11.8% for the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared to 13.5% for the year ended December 31, 2000 or a decrease of 1.7%. This decease was due to start up manufacturing inefficiencies and average lower margins on increased tooling sales. We expect to maintain our current efficiencies and obtain further manufacturing efficiencies in 2002.
Selling, general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2001 decreased by $16.4 million, or 12.6%, to $114.0 million compared to $130.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expense decreased to 6.1% for the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared to 7.1% for the year ended December 31, 2000. The decrease as a percent of net sales and in absolute dollars is primarily attributable to cost control efforts involving increased review of expenses and a reduction in salaried employees. Venture Sales & Engineering (a related party) irrevocably forgave $4.6 million of management fees charged to us, accounting for approximately 0.2% of the decrease. This was done as an inducement to us to lower our quoted price on a prospective new program to an OEM in expectation of receiving this new program. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to be lower in fiscal 2002 due to the adoption of FASB Statement No. 142, wherein we will cease amortizing goodwill. We will begin to periodically evaluate goodwill for impairment amortization expense. Goodwill amortization in fiscal 2001 was $4.4 million.
As a result of the foregoing, income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased $17.8 million, or 18.5%, to $113.8 million, compared to $96.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. As a percentage of net sales, income from operations increased to 6.1% in fiscal 2001 from 5.2% in fiscal 2000.
Interest expense decreased $4.8 million to $97.7 million in fiscal 2001 compared to $102.5 million in fiscal 2000. The decrease was due to the overall reduction in interest rates mitigated by higher average borrowings. This decrease in interest expense was offset by an increase of $2.7 million related to noncash amortization from the termination of interest rate swaps, which increased from $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 to $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001.
Other expense (income) primarily consists of $18.7 million of unrealized currency exchange losses on inter-company loans and a $14 million non cash write down of the deposits made with Shelby American, Inc. in fiscal years 2000 and 1999, (See ""Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transaction--Business Relationships"") offset by approximately $7 million of income due to a settlement, related to pricing issues arising subsequent to a prior acquisition, for domestic operations. (See ""Item 3. Legal Proceedings""). Other (income) expense for the year ended December 31, 2000 consisted of $34.9 million of net realized and unrealized gains on cross-currency interest rate swap and foreign exchange collar derivative transactions and third party interest income of $4.0 million, offset by realized and unrealized currency exchange losses of $33.3 million. (See note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements)
For the year ended December 31, 2001, we reported a net tax benefit of $13.1 million, $18.7 million of this tax benefit was a result of decreasing currency exchange rates related to the Euro, and was offset by $5.6 million of income tax expense charged to the normal operations of Venture Holdings Corporation and the Peguform group of companies.
Due to the foregoing, net income for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $1.0 million compared to net income of $9.0 million for year ended December 31, 2000 or a decrease of $8.0 million. As a percentage of net sales, net income decreased from 0.4% to 0.1%.
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999
Net sales increased $463.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, or 33.9%, to $1,829.9 million, compared to net sales of $1,366.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. This increase was mainly due to the addition of Peguform's net sales for twelve months in 2000 compared to seven months in 1999. On a proforma basis, sales decreased $96.6 million from 1999, with $74.3 million of the decrease was due to Euro devaluation offset by net increases in European volumes. Domestically, sales decreased $22.4 million, or 3.7%, due to a general softening of the automotive market.
Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2000 increased $76.9 million, or 51.0%, to $227.6 million compared to $150.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased from 11.0% for the year ended December 31, 1999 to 12.4% for the year ended December 31, 2000. This dollar increase was mainly due to the addition of Peguform's activity for twelve months in 2000 compared to seven months in 1999. Domestically, gross profit as a percent of sales increased 1.0% due to the implementation of lean manufacturing techniques despite sales reductions. Internationally, gross profit as a percent of sales increased 1.0% due to manufacturing efficiencies. We expect to continue to achieve manufacturing efficiencies in 2001. Effective January 1, 2001, we granted DaimlerChrysler Corporation in North America a 5% sales price reduction. We are attempting to recover all of this from either our suppliers or our own operating efficiencies. We may not be able to fully offset this reduction which could reduce margins.
Selling, general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2000 increased by $21.2 million, or 19.4%, to $130.4 million compared to $109.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expense decreased to 7.1% for the year ended December 31, 2000 as compared to 8.0% for the year ended December 31, 1999. The overall dollar increase was mainly due to the addition of Peguform's activity for twelve months in 2000 compared to seven months in 1999. The decrease as a percent of net sales is primarily attributable to Peguform's lower selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales, relative to Venture's. Venture Sales & Engineering (a related party) eliminated $2.6 million of management fees relating to sales commissions charged to us. This was done due to the slow down in the automotive industry and to ensure that we remained competitive.
As a result of the foregoing, income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2000 increased $54.8 million, or 132.9%, to $96.0 million, compared to $41.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. As a percentage of net sales, income from operations increased to 5.2% in fiscal 2000 from 3.0% in fiscal 1999.
Interest expense increased $29.9 million to $102.5 million in fiscal 2000 compared to $72.6 million in fiscal 1999. The increase is the result of incurring interest for twelve months in 2000 as opposed to only seven months in 1999 related to the increased debt associated with the acquisition of Peguform and rising interest rates. $2.5 million of this expense is noncash amortization from the termination of interest rate swaps.
Other (income) expense includes $75.8 million of realized gains and $40.9 million of unrealized losses related to cross-currency interest rate swap and foreign exchange collar transactions and third party interest income of $4.0 million. Other (income) expense also includes unrealized currency losses of $41.9 million offset by realized currency gains of $8.6 million. (See note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements)
For the year ended December 31, 2000, we reported a net tax benefit of $11.3 million. The tax benefit was generated as a result of finalizing the restructuring of the Peguform companies. $3.1 million was a reduction of the tax rates in Germany and $22.7 million was from the recognition of the benefit of NOL carryforwards. $14.5 million was income tax expense charged to the normal operations of Venture Holdings Corporation and the Peguform Group of companies.
Due to the foregoing, net income for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $9.0 million compared to a net loss of $14.5 million for year ended December 31, 1999.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Our consolidated working capital was $141.5 million at December 31, 2001 compared to $129.5 million at December 31, 2000, an increase of $12.0 million. Our working capital ratio was 1.3x and 1.3x at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities was $63.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $61.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase was caused by a net increase in working capital requirements of approximately $23.0 million consisting of an increase in other current assets, accounts payable and deferred taxes, offset by decreases in accounts receivables, inventory, accrued expenses and other liabilities. In addition, there was a net increase of $16.9 million in fiscal year 2001 associated with currency and hedging transaction losses, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2000. These changes were offset by an increase in net income after adding back noncash charges of $7.9 million.
Capital expenditures were $77.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $85.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. We continue to upgrade machinery and equipment and paint lines at all facilities to handle expected increased volumes and general reconditioning of equipment. In 2000, we received $78.5 million from the termination of derivatives, which resulted in a net use of cash of $6.5 million from investment activities.
In the ordinary course of business, we seek additional business with existing and new customers. We continue to compete for the right to supply new components which could be material to us and require substantial capital investment in machinery, equipment, tooling and facilities. As of the date hereof, however, we have no formal commitments with respect to any such material business. Assuming a constant currency relative to the US dollar, we do expect increasing sales over the next several years but only a slight increase in 2002. This is, however, subject to certain expectations for product demand and currency movements; thus we can give no assurance that increased sales expectations will be achieved. Our volume assumptions are based upon information we obtain from our customers. We are generally assuming currency movements will average at the current levels. In later years, we may be required to replace or update some of our paint lines to handle expected volumes. This decision will be made late in 2002 and would be reflected in 2003 expenditures.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $16.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to net cash used in financing activities of $43.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, which in both years reflects the scheduled paydown of debt offset by increased net borrowings under our revolving credit agreement to fund our operations.
Our senior credit facility provides for borrowings of (1) up to $175.0 million under a revolving credit facility, which, in addition to those matters described below, is used for working capital and general corporate purposes; (2) $75.0 million under a five year term loan A; and (3) $200.0 million under a six year term loan B. The credit facility also originally provided for a $125.0 million 18 month interim term loan which was repaid in full by November of 2000. The senior credit facility was amended in 2000 to extend the date by which we were required to issue $125 million principal amount of securities that rank pari passu in right of payment with, or junior to, our 12% senior subordinated notes due 2009, described below, to March 31, 2002. On March 29, 2002, the senior credit facility was amended to further extend the deadline for this requirement to June 30, 2003. See Note 6 of Notes to consolidated Financial Statements.
The revolving credit facility permits us to borrow up to the lesser of a borrowing base computed as a percentage of accounts receivable and inventory, or $175 million less the amount of any letters of credit issued against the credit agreement. Pursuant to the borrowing base formula as of December 31, 2001, we could have borrowed an additional $28.4 million under the revolving credit facility. Obligations under the senior credit facility are jointly and severally guaranteed by our domestic subsidiaries and are secured by first priority security interests in substantially all of our assets and our domestic subsidiaries. We also rely on the non-recourse sale of certain European automotive company receivables to fund our operations.
The credit agreement and documents governing our $205 million of 9 1/2% senior notes due 2005 (the ""1997 Senior Notes""), and the documents governing our $125 million of 11% unsecured senior notes (the ""1999 Senior Notes"") and 12% unsecured senior subordinated notes (the ""1999 Senior Subordinated Notes"" and together with the 1999 Senior Notes, the ""1999 Notes""), contain restrictive covenants relating to cash flow, fixed charges, debt, member's equity, distributions, leases, and liens on assets. Our debt obligations also contain various restrictive covenants that require us to maintain stipulated financial ratios, including a minimum consolidated net worth (adjusted yearly), fixed charge coverage ratio, interest coverage ratio and total indebtedness ratio. As part of the March 29, 2002 amendment to the credit agreement, an additional restrictive covenant was added that limits our net related party receivables to $65.0 million at December 31, 2001 and requires further reductions over the next several years to a maximum of $35 million by December 31, 2003 and any time thereafter. At December 31, 2002 the net related party receivables balance must not exceed $55 million. As of December 31, 2001, we were in compliance with all debt covenants.
In connection with the senior credit facility and the 1999 Notes, we entered into two five-year Euro dollar cross-currency interest rate swap agreements and one three-year Euro dollar cross-currency interest rate swap agreement.
During 1999, the net impact on earnings due to the cross-currency swap agreements was an unrealized gain of $27.1 million. In March 2000, we terminated our cross-currency swap agreements and realized a cash gain of $42.0 million. As a result of the termination of the cross-currency swap agreements, the net impact on earnings for the twelve months ended December 31, 2000 was a realized gain of $14.9 million.
The cross-currency swap agreements were replaced with a twelve-month zero-cost foreign exchange collar. As a result of these foreign exchange collar transactions, the net impact on earnings for the twelve months ended December 31, 2000 was income of $16.8 million. On March 16, 2001, the original call side of the foreign currency exchange collar expired unexercised.
The interest rate swap agreement within one of our cross-currency swap agreements, which was accounted for using settlement accounting, resulted in interest expense of $0.5 million during 2000. During July 2000, we paid $14.9 million to terminate the interest portion of the cross currency swap agreement. This amount was capitalized and is being amortized over the original term of the cross currency interest rate swap agreements. During 2000 and 2001, interest expense includes $2.5 million and $5.2 million, respectively, of this deferred interest amortization.
The other interest rate swap agreements did not meet all the criteria for settlement accounting. The net impact on earnings during 1999 was an increase in other income of $11.0 million. During July 2000, we terminated these financial instruments and realized a cash gain of $16.9 million plus interest income of $0.1 million. The net impact on earnings during 2000 was an increase in other income of $3.6 million.
We had also entered into interest rate swap agreements with a total notional value of $55.0 million to mitigate the risk associated with changing interest rates on certain floating rate debt. During 2000 and 2001, all of these interest rate swaps agreements expired. All of these interest rate swap agreements were accounted for using settlement accounting. The impact of these interest rate swap agreements resulted in $0.4 million, $0.1 million and $0.8 million of additional interest expense during 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
On January 1, 2001, as a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 133 ""Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities"", we recorded a ($0.2) million cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.
We have not entered into any new hedging agreements since the above described transactions were completed. Consequently, our ability to service our various debt obligations may be effected by our exposure to fluctuations in various foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, as well as fluctuations in interest rates.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
GENERAL
We are principally engaged in the manufacturing and marketing of high-quality PermaClear® polyethylene terephthalate (“PET”) packaging resin, Fortrel® polyester staple fiber, and Wellamid® and Wellamid EcoLon® engineering resin. We utilize a significant amount of recycled raw materials in our manufacturing operations. At December 31, 2006, we had stated annual operating capacity to manufacture approximately 1.4 billion pounds of solid stated PET resin, 0.7 billion pounds of polyester staple fiber, and 70 million pounds of Engineered Resins at four major production facilities in the United States and Europe.
Prior to January 1, 2007, our operations were classified into two reportable operating segments: the Packaging Products Group (PPG) and the Fibers and Recycled Products Group (FRPG). Our PermaClear® PET resin is produced by the PPG from purified terephthalic acid (PTA) and monoethylene glycol (MEG). This PET resin is primarily used in the manufacture of plastic beverage bottles and other food packaging. The FRPG produces Fortrel® and other polyester staple fiber that is primarily used in home furnishing, non-woven, apparel and industrial products. This fiber is produced either from PTA and MEG or recycled raw materials. In addition, the FRPG produces Wellamid® and Wellamid Ecolon® nylon engineering resin that is primarily used in the automotive industry.
In the first quarter of 2007, we announced that we made the strategic decision to focus on our chemical-based PET resin and polyester staple fiber businesses. This will allow us to capitalize on our two world-class, state-of-the art facilities which utilize some of the latest technology to produce a wide variety of high-quality, value-added products. The scale and flexibility of these facilities allow us to service the PET resin and fiber markets with the right products at competitive costs. We are changing our management organization and internal financial reporting structure to reflect and support our new strategy. We are moving from a divisional organization to a functional one, which should allow us to better utilize our human resources, focus on our end markets, reduce operating and logistical costs, and improve efficiencies at our manufacturing facilities. As part of this change, we reorganized our operations into a chemical-based segment and a recycled-based segment.
Our chemical-based segment is principally engaged in the manufacturing and marketing of high-quality PermaClear® polyethylene terephthalate (“PET”) packaging resin and Fortrel® polyester staple fiber. At December 31, 2006, this segment had stated annual operating capacity to manufacture approximately 1.9 billion pounds of polyester, consisting of 1.4 billion pounds of solid-stated PET resin and 0.5 billion pounds of polyester staple fiber. We manufacture these products at two major production facilities in the United States.
Our recycled-based segment is principally engaged in the manufacturing and marketing of recycled-based polyester staple fiber in Europe sold under the tradenames of Wellbond®, Wellene®, and Fillwell® for use in non-woven, home furnishing, and industrial products and Wellamid® and Wellamid Ecolon® recycled-based nylon engineering resin in the U.S. for use in the injection molding industry. At December 31, 2006, this segment had stated annual operating capacity to manufacture approximately 0.2 billion pounds. We are exploring strategic alternatives for these businesses to allow us to improve our operating results, generate cash to pay down debt, and provide the highest possible return to our stockholders.
North American and global PET resin demand continues to grow, driven by new product applications for PET, conversions from other packaging materials to PET, and overall growth in beverage and food consumption. Demand for polyester staple fiber is subject to changes in consumer preferences and spending, retail sales patterns, and fiber and textile product imports. Imports continue to negatively impact the United States and European polyester staple fiber and PET resin markets, adversely affecting our operating results.
Our financial results are primarily determined by our sales volume and raw material margins, which is the difference between net selling price and raw material cost. Both PET resin and polyester staple fiber volume and raw material margins increase or decrease as a result of supply and demand factors, competitive conditions, global economic and market conditions, export and import activity, and the prices of competing materials. Seasonal factors, such as weather and the vacation and holiday closings of our facilities or those of our customers, may also affect our operations. Given our substantial unit volumes, the impact on profitability of changes in raw material
margins is significant. A one-cent per pound change in raw material margin on approximately 2.1 billion pounds of sales volume results in an annual change of approximately $21.0 million in pre-tax earnings.
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
New Organization
In the first quarter of 2007, we announced that we made the strategic decision to focus on our chemical-based PET resin and polyester staple fiber businesses. This will allow us to capitalize on our two world-class, state-of-the-art facilities which utilize some of the latest technology to produce a wide variety of high-quality, value-added products. The scale and flexibility of these facilities allow us to service the PET resin and polyester staple fiber markets with the right products at competitive costs. We are changing our management organization and internal financial reporting structure to reflect and support our new strategy. We are moving from a divisional organization to a functional one, which should allow us to better utilize our human resources, focus on serving our end markets, reduce operating and logistical costs, and improve efficiencies at our manufacturing facilities. As part of this change, we reorganized our operations into a chemical-based segment and a recycled-based segment. We have previously announced that we are exploring strategic alternatives for our non-core businesses which make up the recycled-based segment.
Discontinued Operations
During the fourth quarter of 2006, we made a decision to dispose of our European PET resins business. These assets are expected to be disposed of in the first half of 2007. The assets of this business have met the criteria for, and have been classified as “held for sale” in accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.”
We recorded a pretax loss of $26.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 to reduce the value of these assets to their fair value and an expected loss on disposal. These were included in discontinued operations in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. For additional information, including a breakdown of the results for discontinued operations, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Impairment of Goodwill
Based on our evaluation of goodwill at October 1, 2006, we recorded a non-cash impairment loss of $33.4 million during the fourth quarter of 2006, which represented the carrying amount of our PPG goodwill. For information on how the impairment was calculated, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” above and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Johnsonville Fibers Closure Costs
During the third quarter of 2006, we announced a plan to close the Johnsonville fibers operation with the intention of improving our operating results, reducing our working capital and lowering overall debt. We have closed the 160 million pounds of polyester staple fiber capacity at our Johnsonville, South Carolina facility during the fourth quarter of 2006 and consolidated all of our U.S. polyester staple fiber production into our Palmetto facility, located in Darlington, South Carolina, which has an annual capacity of 500 million pounds. We expect to sell the assets of our Material Recycling Division (“MRD”) which has the annual capacity to convert 190 million pounds of post-consumer PET bottles to flake and certain equipment used to produce Wellstrand® (specialty polyester and nylon coarse denier fibers), both located at our Johnsonville facility. During 2006, the FRPG recorded total charges related to the Johnsonville fibers closure of $33.3 million, approximately $30.0 million of which will not have a cash impact. For additional information on the closure, including details of the charges, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. As disclosed in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in financial statements and accompanying notes.
We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements; therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue from sales to customers is recognized at the time of transfer of title and risk of loss to the customer, which usually occurs at the time of shipment. Revenue is recognized at the time of delivery if we retain the risk of loss during shipment. For products that are shipped on a consignment basis, revenue is recognized when the customer uses the product.
Costs incurred in shipping the products sold are included in cost of sales. Billings to customers for shipping costs are included in the sales revenue. Provisions for allowances, discounts and rebates to customers are recorded at the time of sale based on our best estimates, which may change. A considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate amount of allowances, discounts, and rebates. Our estimates could vary significantly from actual amounts realized, resulting in adjustments to selling prices. A $0.01 adjustment to the selling price without a corresponding change in raw material cost for one quarter on 0.5 billion pounds would result in a $5.0 million adjustment to our pretax earnings (loss).
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
We perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition. We have established an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our evaluation of the credit-worthiness of our customers and the potential risks inherent in their businesses. A considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables, especially in light of the difficult economic conditions facing our customers. These judgments could vary significantly from actual amounts realized, resulting in changes in bad debt expense and allowances. The allowance for doubtful accounts will increase or decrease based on circumstances or specific events impacting customers, including bankruptcy filings and changes in the customers’ financial condition. For the past three years, our write-offs have ranged between $0.4 million and $0.7 million. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. As disclosed in Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, six of our customers comprised approximately 44% of our total accounts receivable at December 31, 2006. A downturn in the financial condition of any of these customers may have a negative impact on our financial results. For trade receivables of $192.9 million and $159.3 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, our allowances were $2.2 million and $2.1 million, respectively.
Inventory Valuation
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is recorded based on the purchase price of goods less estimated rebates or credits, and we principally use a first-in, first-out (FIFO) flow of inventory assumption. The physical condition (i.e., quality) of the inventories is also considered in establishing the valuation. Our estimates of rebates, credits and the physical condition of the goods are judgments and the actual results could vary significantly, either favorably or unfavorably. We have approximately 180 and 228 million pounds of polyester equivalent inventory at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. A $0.01 valuation allowance on all our inventories is approximately $1.8 million and $2.3 million for December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Changes in our inventory valuation resulting from such variances would affect our cost of sales. Inventories of $143.6 million and $153.6 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, were net of reserves of $3.2 million and $0.9 million, respectively.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation for assets is provided based on their estimated useful lives and is computed using the straight-line method or the units of production method. Changes in
circumstances such as technological advances, changes to our capital strategy, or changes to our business model could result in the actual lives differing from our estimates, in which case our operating results could be affected.
We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a fixed asset group may not be recoverable. Such events and circumstances include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of a group of assets, adverse changes in the extent or manner in which the group of assets are being used, significant changes in the business climate, or current or projected cash flow losses associated with the use of a group of assets. If any of the impairment indicators are present or if other circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, we then determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized. We estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the entire facility or site to determine its fair market value and whether or not a potential impairment exists. In estimating the future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by long-lived assets to be held and used, major assumptions and estimates include the expected period of operation, projected product pricing, raw material costs, and market supply and demand. Changes in any of these estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on the estimated future cash flows to be generated by our assets. If the carrying value exceeds the estimate of future undiscounted cash flows, we then calculate and record the impairment, which is equal to the excess of the carrying value of the asset over the estimate of its fair market value. For long-lived assets to be held and used, fair value is determined primarily using either the projected cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks involved or an appraisal. For long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale, fair value is determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced by disposal costs.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142 “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” goodwill, which is allocated to our PPG, is no longer amortized, but we test for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level by comparing the estimated future discounted cash flows to the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill. We use a two-step test to measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized, if any. The first step of the goodwill impairment test, used to identify potential impairment, compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired, thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The loss is limited to the carrying amount of the goodwill, and the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill will be used as its new accounting basis.
The estimate of future discounted cash flows is based upon, among other things, certain assumptions about future operating performance. Our estimates of future discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to, among other things, changes in economic conditions, our business model, and/or our operating performance.
Based on our evaluation of goodwill at October 1, 2006, we recognized expense of $33.4 million in the fourth quarter 2006, which represented the carrying amount of our goodwill.
Deferred Tax Assets
We record deferred tax assets for tax benefits we expect to be recognized in future periods, principally as a result of the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. We have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. If our businesses do not perform as expected, the valuation allowance may change. If that occurred, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would result in an increase or decrease in our tax expense (benefit) in the period such determination was made.
Environmental Liability
Our operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations governing air emissions, wastewater discharges, and solid and hazardous waste management activities. Our policy is to expense environmental remediation costs when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The accruals represent our best estimate of probable non-capital environmental expenditures. Changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement actions, or changes in health, environmental, and chemical control regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs and, therefore, may have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period. Estimated future environmental expenditures for remediation costs range from the minimum of $2.3 million to the maximum of $6.9 million on an undiscounted basis at December 31, 2006. In connection with these contingencies, we have accrued undiscounted liabilities of approximately $5.1 million and $6.6 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which represent our best estimate of probable non-capital environmental expenditures.
Pension Benefits
We have defined benefit plans and defined contribution pension plans that cover substantially all employees. Several statistical and other factors, which attempt to anticipate future events, are used in calculating the expense and liability (asset) related to the defined benefit plans. Key factors include the discount rate and other assumptions about the expected rates of return on plan assets, salary and pension increases and mortality tables. We consider the guidance of our professional advisors as well as market conditions, including changes in investment returns and interest rates, in making these assumptions.
We manage the assets in our defined benefit plans to obtain the highest possible return over the long-term commensurate with the appropriate level of assumed risk. In order to moderate the investment portfolio’s volatility, we forecast financial market returns over a wide range of potential future economic trends. The expected rate of return on plan assets is a long-term assumption and is reviewed annually. The discount rate reflects the market rate for high-quality fixed income debt instruments at December 31 and is subject to change each year. Holding all other assumptions constant, a one-percentage-point (1.0%) change in the assumed rate of return on plan assets for one year would result in an actuarial loss in 2007 of approximately $1.4 million. Likewise, a ten basis point (0.1%) change in the discount rate would increase our projected benefit obligations by approximately $3.0 million.
During the first quarter of 2006, we voluntarily changed our accounting principle for recognizing net actuarial gains or losses relating to our defined benefit plans. Historically, we amortized actuarial gains and losses for our domestic and Dutch plans using the corridor method as defined by SFAS No. 87, “Employer’s Accounting for Pensions.” For our Irish plans, we used a five-year straight-line method (subject to the minimum amortization provisions of SFAS No. 87). We are now recognizing the net actuarial gains or losses in the fourth quarter of the year they are incurred in conjunction with our annual actuarial valuations. Actuarial gains and losses result from differences between the actual results and the assumptions used for the discount rate, return on assets, wage and inflation assumptions, changes in mortality tables and various other assumptions.
The actuarial assumptions we used in determining our pension benefits may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants. While we believe the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may be material.
IMPACT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In February 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 155 (“SFAS 155”), “Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments - an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140.” SFAS 155 primarily resolves certain issues addressed in the implementation of FASB Statement No. 133 concerning beneficial interest in securitized financial assets and is effective for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2006. It will be effective for all financial instruments acquired, issued, or subject to a re-measurement (new basis) event occurring after the beginning of the year of adoption. The adoption of SFAS 155 is not expected to have a material effect on our Statements of Operations or financial position.
In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 (“FIN 48”), “Uncertainty in Income Taxes - an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109”. This interpretation clarifies the accounting and financial statement reporting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and is required to be adopted as of January 1, 2007. The adoption of this interpretation is not expected to have a material effect on our Statement of Operations or financial position. In February 2007, we elected to participate in the Internal Revenue Service’s FIN 48 Initiative to expedite resolution of an uncertain tax position regarding our repatriation of foreign earnings and expect a resolution in 2007. The tax effect will be recorded in the period of resolution.
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements”. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. It will be effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The adoption of SFAS No. 157 is not expected to have a material effect on our Statement of Operations or financial position.
In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities - Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115.” This Statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The fair value option established by this Statement permits all entities to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates and report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings (loss) at each subsequent reporting date. It will be effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The adoption of SFAS No. 159 is not expected to have a material effect on our Statement of Operations or financial position.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
to 2005
The following table summarizes reasons for the changes in 2006 compared to 2005 for net sales, cost of sales, and gross profit.
(a)
Certain amounts have been adjusted to reflect our voluntary change in accounting principle for recognizing actuarial gains and losses related to our defined benefit plans and revised to reflect discontinued operations.
Net sales increased during 2006 due primarily to increased sales volumes in the PPG and higher net selling prices in the FRPG. Net selling prices for the FRPG increased in response to higher chemical raw material costs. PPG sales volumes during the 2006 period increased compared to the same period in 2005 primarily due to the completion in June of 2006 of our PET resin expansion (which increased our annual capacity by 300 million pounds) and lower operating capacity in 2005 due to hurricane Katrina. PPG was also positively impacted by the
improved overall industry demand for PET resins. FRPG experienced decreased sales volumes during 2006 compared to 2005 due mainly to a reduction in U.S. polyester staple fiber demand caused by increased imports of fiber and downstream textile and apparel products.
The increase in cost of sales during 2006 is due mainly to increased raw material costs over 2005. The higher raw material unit costs during 2006 were due primarily to significant increases in the cost of PTA, our major raw material, which is derived from mixed xylenes (MX) and paraxylenes (PX). The increase in PX costs during 2006 resulted from a tightened worldwide supply-demand balance, which was further exacerbated by a number of PX production facilities throughout the world operating at less than full capacity and from the increase in U.S. MX prices, the feedstock for PX.
These changes in selling prices and raw material costs resulted in lower raw material margins during 2006 compared to 2005 for both the PPG and FRPG.
Plant-added unit costs were slightly higher than these costs in 2005 due to depreciation expense related to the start-up of our Pearl River facility expansion.
Due primarily to volatile raw material costs and our inability to increase and maintain selling prices in response to higher raw material costs, gross profit decreased by $81.1 million to $38.6 million in 2006 from $119.7 million in 2005.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $55.2 million, or 4.1% of net sales, in 2006 compared to $58.5 million, or 4.5% of net sales, in 2005, primarily due to lower compensation expense because no incentive compensation payments were earned in 2006.
We incurred restructuring charges of $1.5 million and $0.6 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. For additional information, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
We recorded a charge for expected losses on accounts receivable of $0.4 million and $0.5 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively.
The following table details Other expense, net for 2006 and 2005:
We incurred charges of $33.3 million related to the Johnsonville fibers closure during 2006. Approximately $30.0 million of these charges were for non-cash items related to asset write-downs. The remaining portion of the closure charges were mainly employee restructuring charges. For additional information, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Based on our evaluation of goodwill at October 1, 2006, we recognized expense of $33.4 million during the fourth quarter of 2006, which represented the carrying amount of our goodwill which was in the PPG. For information on how the impairment was calculated, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” above and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
In the first quarter of 2006, we voluntarily changed our accounting principle for recognizing net actuarial gains or losses relating to our defined benefit plans. We are now recognizing the net actuarial gains or losses in the fourth quarter of the year they are incurred in conjunction with our annual actuarial valuations. For additional information related to the actuarial gains and losses, see Notes 2 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Legal costs consisted of fees, settlements, and other expenses in connection with an investigation by the Department of Justice (which it has since abandoned) and related civil litigation. These amounts were significantly higher in 2005 when we settled all the federal claims of any direct purchasers of polyester staple fiber. For additional information on legal costs, see Item 3. “Legal Proceedings” and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Hurricane Katrina costs, net consist of expenses incurred related to hurricane Katrina, which include direct damages, inventory loss, railcar damage, fixed costs, infrastructure support, and increased freight costs, net of any reimbursement we received. For additional information on the effect of hurricane Katrina on our operations, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
In October 2000, the U.S. Congress enacted the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act of 2000 (the “CDO”). Under the CDO, any anti-dumping duties collected are paid to the injured companies who file claims to that effect. We received a net cash benefit of $2.0 million and $3.7 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease in 2006 is primarily due to a decrease in the volume of imported fiber subject to antidumping duties.
As a result of the foregoing, we reported an operating loss of $62.4 million in 2006, compared to an operating loss of $37.5 million in 2005.
Interest expense, net was $58.0 million in 2006, compared to $45.4 million in 2005. This increase was primarily due to increased interest rates and higher debt balances.
Our effective tax rate for 2006 on the loss from continuing operations was 30.5% compared to 29.4% in 2005. Our tax rate for 2006 on the loss from continuing operations was affected by a non-deductible impairment loss for Goodwill and foreign earnings taxed at favorable tax rates.
As a result of the foregoing, we reported a net loss from continuing operations of $83.7 million for 2006, or $3.07 per diluted share, compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $58.5 million, or $2.29 per diluted share, for 2005.
During the fourth quarter of 2006, we made a decision to dispose of our European PET resins business. The loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $28.7 million, or $0.90 per diluted share, in 2006, compared to a loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $1.4 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, in 2005. The 2006 results included a pretax loss of $26.5 million to reduce the value of the European PET resin assets to their fair value and an expected loss on disposal. For additional information, including a breakdown of the results for discontinued operations, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
We recorded accretion based on the fair market value of the increase in the liquidation preference of the preferred stock and the amortization of the discount related to the common stock warrants. This amount was $14.4 million and $14.2 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively.
As a result of the foregoing, we reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $126.8 million, or $3.97 per diluted share, for 2006, compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $74.1 million, or $2.34 per diluted share, for 2005.

"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing in ""Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."" The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance. The forward-looking statements are dependent upon events, risks and uncertainties that may be outside our control. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, market prices for oil, natural gas and NGL, production volumes, estimates of proved reserves, capital expenditures, economic and competitive conditions, regulatory changes and other uncertainties, as well as those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly in ""Risk Factors"" and ""Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,"" all of which are difficult to predict. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed may not occur. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements except as otherwise required by applicable law.
This section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2019 and 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018. Discussions of 2017 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2018 and 2017 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in ""Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 and are incorporated herein by reference.
OVERVIEW
We are an independent oil and gas company focused on the acquisition, development and production of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves, as well as the construction and support of midstream assets to gather and process crude oil and gas production in the Rocky Mountain region, primarily in the Wattenberg Field of the Denver-Julesburg Basin (the ""DJ Basin"") of Colorado. We have developed an oil, natural gas and NGL asset base of proved reserves, as well as a portfolio of development drilling opportunities on high resource-potential leasehold on contiguous acreage blocks in some of the most productive areas of what we consider to be the core of the DJ Basin. Toward the end of the third quarter and into the fourth quarter of 2019, management elected to shift the corporate strategy from one of maximizing production and reserve growth to one focused on cash flow and reducing debt while improving our liquidity.
Our revenue, profitability and future growth rate depend on many factors which are beyond our control, such as oil and gas prices, economic, political and regulatory developments, competition from other sources of energy, and the other items discussed under the caption “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Annual Report. Lower commodity prices may also reduce the amount of the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility, which is determined at the discretion of our lenders and is based on the collateral value of our proved reserves that have been mortgaged to the lenders. Upon any redetermination, if total outstanding commitments exceed the redetermined borrowing base, we are required to prepay outstanding loans in an aggregate principal amount equal to such excess in three substantially equal monthly installments.
Our Properties and Operations
We have assembled, as of December 31, 2019, approximately 169,900 net acres of large, contiguous acreage blocks in some of the most productive areas of what we consider to be the core of the DJ Basin as indicated by the results of our horizontal drilling program and the results of offset operators. Additionally, we hold approximately 125,500 net acres outside of what we consider our Core DJ Basin, which we refer to as our ""Other Rockies Area,"" that we believe is prospective for many of the same formations as our properties in the Core DJ Basin. We operated 96% of our horizontal production for the year ended December 31, 2019, our total estimated proved reserves were approximately 254.1 MMBoe, of which approximately 56% were classified as proved developed reserves. For more information about our properties, please read ""Business-Our Properties."" in Items 1 and 2 of this Annual Report.
Our unrestricted subsidiary, Elevation, is focused on the construction of gathering systems and facilities operations to serve the development of our acreage in the Hawkeye and Southwest Wattenberg areas. Midstream assets of Elevation are represented as the gathering systems and facilities line item within the consolidated balance sheets. In October 2019, Elevation commenced moving crude oil, natural gas and water through its newly constructed Badger central gathering facility. This facility enables Extraction and will enable others to efficiently transport crude oil and natural gas production along with water used during the completion process. The use of this gathering facility allows for the elimination of oil or water storage on the well pad site and reduces truck traffic, which minimizes the impact to the surrounding environment and communities. Revenues
and operating expenses associated with the gathering systems and facilities operations are primarily derived from intersegment transactions for services provided to our development and production operations as well as third parties.
Financial Overview
For the year ended December 31, 2019, we had a net loss of $1.4 billion as compared to net income of $121.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The change to net loss was primarily driven by a decrease in sales revenues of $154.1 million, coupled with an increase in operating expenses of $1.5 billion, which includes an increase of $1.3 billion in the impairment of long-lived assets and a decrease in the gain on sale of property and equipment and assets of unconsolidated subsidiary of $137.3 million. Additionally, we had a decrease in interest expense of $44.1 million.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, crude oil, natural gas, NGL sales and gathering and compression revenue, coupled with the impact of settled derivatives, decreased to $881.9 million as compared to $930.1 million in the same prior year period due to a decrease of $6.33 in realized price per BOE, including settled derivatives, offset by an increase in sales volumes of approximately 4,600 MBoe.
Adjusted EBITDAX was $610.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $659.8 million in the same period in 2018, reflecting a 7% decrease. Adjusted EBITDAX is a non-GAAP financial measure. For a definition of Adjusted EBITDAX and a reconciliation to our most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, please read ""Adjusted EBITDAX.""
Operational Overview
During the year ended December 31, 2019, we focused on improving free cash flow and implemented operational efficiencies to reduce drilling and completion costs. We incurred approximately $542.8 million in drilling 107 gross (99.6 net) wells with an average lateral length of 2.0 miles and completing 119 gross (104.3 net) wells with an average lateral length of 1.9 miles, all of which were horizontal wells in the DJ Basin. In addition, we incurred approximately $54.9 million of leasehold and surface acreage additions. In addition, Elevation Midstream, LLC, our midstream subsidiary, incurred $202.6 million of capital expenditures.
How We Evaluate Our Operations
We use a variety of financial and operational metrics to assess the performance of our oil and gas operations, including:
•Sources of revenue;
•Sales volumes;
•Realized prices on the sale of oil, natural gas and NGL, including the effect of our commodity derivative contracts;
•Lease operating expenses (""LOE"");
•Capital expenditures;
•Adjusted EBITDAX (a Non-GAAP measure); and
•Free cash flow (a Non-GAAP measure).
Sources of Revenues
Our revenues are derived from the sale of our oil and natural gas production, as well as the sale of NGL that are extracted from our natural gas during processing. Our oil, natural gas and NGL revenues do not include the effects of derivatives. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our revenues were derived 80% from oil sales, 12% from natural gas sales and 8% from NGL sales. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our revenues were derived 79% from oil sales, 10% from natural gas sales and 11% from NGL sales. Our revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of changes in volumes of production sold or changes in commodity prices.
Sales Volumes
The following table presents historical sales volumes for the periods indicated:
As reservoir pressures decline, production from a given well or formation decreases. Growth in our future production and reserves will depend on our ability to continue to add or develop proved reserves in excess of our production. Accordingly, we plan to maintain our focus on adding reserves through organic growth as well as acquisitions. Our ability to add reserves through development projects and acquisitions is dependent on many factors, including takeaway capacity in our areas of operation and our ability to raise capital, obtain regulatory approvals, procure contract drilling rigs and personnel and successfully identify and consummate acquisitions. Please read ""Risks Related to the Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Industry and Our Business"" in Item 1A. of this Annual Report for a further description of the risks that affect us.
Realized Prices on the Sale of Oil, Natural Gas and NGL
Our results of operations depend upon many factors, particularly the price of oil, natural gas and NGL and our ability to market our production effectively. Oil, natural gas and NGL prices are among the most volatile of all commodity prices. Declines in, and continued depression of, the price of oil and natural gas occurring during 2018 and 2019 are due to a combination of factors including increased U.S. supply, global economic concerns and geopolitical risks. These price variations can have a material impact on our financial results and capital expenditures.
Oil pricing is predominately driven by the physical market, supply and demand, financial markets and national and international politics. The NYMEX WTI futures price is a widely used benchmark in the pricing of domestic and imported oil in the United States. The actual prices realized from the sale of oil differ from the quoted NYMEX WTI price as a result of quality and location differentials. In the DJ Basin, oil is sold under various purchase contracts with monthly pricing provisions based on NYMEX pricing, adjusted for differentials.
Natural gas prices vary by region and locality, depending upon the distance to markets, availability of pipeline capacity and supply and demand relationships in that region or locality. The NYMEX Henry Hub price of natural gas is a widely used benchmark for the pricing of natural gas in the United States. Similar to oil, the actual prices realized from the sale of natural gas differ from the quoted NYMEX Henry Hub price as a result of quality and location differentials. For example, wet natural gas with a high Btu content sells at a premium to low Btu content dry natural gas because it yields a greater quantity of NGL. Location differentials to NYMEX Henry Hub prices result from variances in transportation costs based on the natural gas’ proximity to the major consuming markets to which it is ultimately delivered. Also affecting the differential is the processing fee deduction retained by the natural gas processing plant, generally in the form of percentage of proceeds. The price we receive for our natural gas produced in the DJ Basin is based on CIG prices, adjusted for certain deductions.
Our price for NGL produced in the DJ Basin is based on a combination of prices from the Conway hub in Kansas and Mont Belvieu in Texas where this production is marketed.
The following table provides the high and low prices for NYMEX WTI and NYMEX Henry Hub prompt month contract prices and our differential to the average of those benchmark prices for the periods indicated. The differential varies, but our oil, natural gas and NGL normally sells at a discount to the NYMEX WTI and NYMEX Henry Hub price, as applicable.
(1)Includes non-cash amounts allocated to a satisfied performance obligation, recognized within oil sales for the year ended December 31, 2019, pursuant to ASC 606, Revenue Recognition.
(2)Excludes non-cash amounts allocated to a satisfied performance obligation, recognized within oil sales for the year ended December 31, 2019, pursuant to ASC 606, Revenue Recognition.
(3)Based on the difference between our average realized price and the NYMEX Henry Hub Average as converted into Mcf using a conversion factor of 1.1 to 1.
(4)The decrease year over year is primarily due to capacity constraints in transporting the wet gas associated with our production coupled with negative market conditions surrounding limited export capacity.
Derivative Arrangements
To achieve more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in commodity prices, from time to time we enter into derivative arrangements for our oil and natural gas production. By removing a significant portion of price volatility associated with our oil and natural gas production, we believe we will mitigate, but not eliminate, the potential negative effects of reductions in oil and natural gas prices on our cash flow from operations for those periods. However, in a portion of our current positions, our hedging activity may also reduce our ability to benefit from increases in oil and natural gas prices. We will sustain losses to the extent our derivatives contract prices are lower than market prices and, conversely, we will realize gains to the extent our derivatives contract prices are higher than market prices. In certain circumstances, where we have unrealized gains in our derivative portfolio, we may choose to restructure existing derivative contracts or enter into new transactions to modify the terms of current contracts in order to realize the current value of our existing positions. See ""-Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk-Commodity Price Risk"" for information regarding our exposure to market risk, including the effects of changes in commodity prices, and our commodity derivative contracts.
We will continue to use commodity derivative instruments to hedge our price risk in the future. Our hedging strategy and future hedging transactions will be determined at our discretion and may be different than what we have done on a
historical basis. As a result of recent volatility in the price of oil and natural gas, we have relied on a variety of hedging strategies and instruments to hedge our future price risk. We have utilized swaps, put options, and call options, which in some instances require the payment of a premium, to reduce the effect of price changes on a portion of our future oil and natural gas production. We expect to continue to use a variety of hedging strategies and instruments for the foreseeable future.
A swap has an established fixed price. When the settlement price is below the fixed price, the counterparty pays us an amount equal to the difference between the settlement price and the fixed price multiplied by the hedged contract volume. When the settlement price is above the fixed price, we pay our counterparty an amount equal to the difference between the settlement price and the fixed price multiplied by the hedged contract volume.
A put option has an established floor price. The buyer of the put option pays the seller a premium to enter into the put option. When the settlement price is below the floor price, the seller pays the buyer an amount equal to the difference between the settlement price and the strike price multiplied by the hedged contract volume. When the settlement price is above the floor price, the put option expires worthless. Some of our purchased put options have deferred premiums. For the deferred premium puts, we agreed to pay a premium to the counterparty at the time of settlement.
A call option has an established ceiling price. The buyer of the call option pays the seller a premium to enter into the call option. When the settlement price is above the ceiling price, the seller pays the buyer an amount equal to the difference between the settlement price and the strike price multiplied by the hedged contract volume. When the settlement price is below the ceiling price, the call option expires worthless.
We combine swaps, purchased put options, sold put options, and sold call options in order to achieve various hedging strategies. Some examples of our hedging strategies are collars which include purchased put options and sold call options, three-way collars which include purchased put options, sold put options, and sold call options, and enhanced swaps, which include either sold put options or sold call options with the associated premiums rolled into an enhanced fixed price swap. We have historically relied on commodity derivative contracts to mitigate our exposure to lower commodity prices.
We have historically been able to hedge our oil and natural gas production at prices that are significantly higher than current strip prices. However, in the current commodity price environment, our ability to enter into comparable derivative arrangements at favorable prices may be limited, and we are not obligated to hedge a specific portion of our oil or natural gas production. The following summarizes our net derivative positions related to crude oil and natural gas sales in effect as of December 31, 2019:
The following table summarizes our historical derivative positions and the settlement amounts for each of the periods indicated.
Lease Operating Expenses
All direct and allocated indirect costs of lifting hydrocarbons from a producing formation to the surface constitutes part of the current operating expenses of a working interest. Such costs include labor, superintendence, supplies, repairs, maintenance, water injection and disposal costs, allocated overhead charges, workover, insurance and other expenses incidental to production, but exclude lease acquisition or drilling or completion expenses.
Capital Expenditures
For the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred approximately $542.8 million in drilling and completion capital expenditures. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we drilled 107 gross (99.6 net) wells with an average lateral length of approximately 2.0 miles and completed 119 gross (104.3 net) wells with an average lateral length of approximately 1.9 miles. We turned to sales 115 gross (101.9 net) wells with an average lateral length of approximately 1.8 miles. In addition, we incurred approximately $54.9 million of leasehold and surface acreage additions. In addition, Elevation, our midstream subsidiary, incurred $202.6 million of capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Our 2020 capital budget for the drilling and completion of operated and non-operated wells is approximately $425 million to $475 million, substantially all of which we intend to allocate to the Core DJ Basin. We expect to drill 86 gross operated wells, complete 86 gross operated wells and turn-in-line 92 gross operated wells. Our capital budget anticipates a one to two operated rig drilling program and excludes up to $50 million for Elevation, a portion of which will be funded by Extraction.
The amount and timing of these capital expenditures is within our control and subject to our management’s discretion. We retain the flexibility to defer a portion of these planned capital expenditures depending on a variety of factors, including but not limited to the success of our drilling activities, prevailing and anticipated prices for oil, natural gas and NGL, the availability of necessary equipment, infrastructure and capital, the receipt and timing of required regulatory permits and approvals, seasonal conditions, drilling and acquisition costs and the level of participation by other interest owners. Any postponement or elimination of our development drilling program could result in a reduction of proved reserve volumes and related standardized measure. These risks could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Adjusted EBITDAX
Adjusted EBITDAX is not a measure of net income (loss) as determined by United States generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""). Adjusted EBITDAX is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that is used by management and external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. We define Adjusted EBITDAX as net income (loss) adjusted for certain cash and non-cash items, including depletion, depreciation, amortization and accretion, impairment of long lived assets and goodwill, exploration and abandonment expenses, gain (loss) on sale of property and equipment and assets of unconsolidated subsidiary, (gain) loss on commodity derivatives, settlements on commodity derivative instruments, premiums paid for derivatives that settled during the period, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of debt issuance costs, make-whole premiums on 2021 Senior Notes, gain on repurchase of 2026 Senior Notes, interest expense, and income tax (benefit) expense. Adjusted EBITDAX is also used to evaluate the performance of reportable segments. See Note 18 - Segment Information in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information regarding the EBITDAX of reportable segments.
Management believes Adjusted EBITDAX is useful because it allows us to more effectively evaluate our operating performance and compare the results of our operations from period to period without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. We exclude the items listed above from net income (loss) in arriving at Adjusted EBITDAX because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDAX should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss) as determined in accordance with GAAP or as an indicator of our operating performance. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDAX are significant components in understanding and assessing a company's financial performance, such as a company's cost of capital, hedging strategy and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are components of Adjusted EBITDAX. Our computations of Adjusted EBITDAX may not be comparable to other similarly titled measure of other companies. We believe that Adjusted EBITDAX is a widely followed measure of operating performance. Additionally, our management team believes Adjusted EBITDAX is useful to an investor in evaluating our financial performance because this measure (i) is widely used by investors in the oil and natural gas industry to measure a company's operating performance without regard to items excluded from the calculation of such term, among other factors; (ii) helps investors to more meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the effect of our capital structure from our operating structure; and (iii) is used by our management team for various purposes, including as a measure of operating performance, in presentations to our board of directors, as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting.
The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDAX to the GAAP financial measure of net income (loss) for each of the periods indicated (in thousands).
Free Cash Flow
Our Free Cash Flow is not a measure of net income (loss) as determined by GAAP. We define Free Cash Flow as Discretionary Cash Flow (non-GAAP) less Adjusted Cash Flow used in Investing (non-GAAP) adjusted for Other Non-Recurring Adjustments (non-GAAP). Discretionary Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities (GAAP) less changes in working capital (current assets and liabilities). Adjusted Cash Flow used in Investing is defined as cash flow used in investing activities (GAAP) adjusted for changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities related to capital expenditures.
Free Cash Flow is used by management and external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. We believe Free Cash Flow can provide additional transparency into the drivers of trends in our operating cash flows, such as production, realized sales prices and operating costs, as it disregards the timing of settlement of operating assets and liabilities. We believe Free Cash Flow provides additional information that may be useful in an analysis of our ability to generate cash to fund exploration and development activities, construct and support midstream assets, and to return capital to stockholders.
The following tables present a reconciliation of Discretionary Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow to the GAAP financial measure of net cash provided by operating activities for each of the periods indicated.
(1) Amount incurred for the construction of our field office that is included in other property and equipment in our consolidated statements of cash flows.
Items Affecting the Comparability of Our Financial Results
Our historical results of operations for the periods presented may not be comparable, either to each other or to our future results of operations, for the reasons described below:
•On January 1, 2019, we adopted ASC 842 - Leases. We adopted using the modified retrospective transition approach to apply the new standard to all leases entered into on or after January 1, 2019 and all existing leases. ASC 842 supersedes previous lease recognition requirements in ASC 840 and resulted in the recognition of $29.2 million of right-of-use assets and $34.6 million of lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019. See Note 5-Leases in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information.
•For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, exploration and abandonment expenses increased primarily due to the abandonment and impairment of $73.7 million and $25.7 million of unproved properties.
•For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 we recognized $14.5 million and $16.2 million, respectively, in impairment expense on our proved oil and gas properties related to assets in our northern field.
•For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized $1.3 billion in impairment expense on our proved oil and gas properties related to assets in our Core DJ Basin field. No impairment expense was recognized for the years ended December 31, 2018 on proved oil and gas properties in our Core DJ Basin field.
•For the year ended December 31, 2018, we fully impaired our goodwill and recognized $54.2 million of impairment expense.
•For the year ended December 31, 2019, we had an insignificant net loss from divestitures, whereas, in 2018 we realized a gain of $136.8 million from the sale of property and equipment and assets of our unconsolidated subsidiary.

Our calculation of such effects includes both gains and losses on cash settlements for commodity derivatives and premiums paid or received on options that settled during the period.
(3)Includes amounts allocated to a satisfied performance obligation, recognized within oil sales for the year ended December 31, 2019, pursuant to ASC 606, Revenue Recognition.
(4)Cash general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 includes expense of $2.3 million related to the terms of separation agreements with two former executive officers. Excluding these one-time expenses results in cash general and administrative expense per BOE of $1.62 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
(5)Excludes (gain) loss on sale of property and equipment and assets of unconsolidated subsidiary and impairment of long lived assets and goodwill.
Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018
Oil sales revenues. Crude oil sales revenues decreased by $119.3 million to $721.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to crude oil sales of $840.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. An increase in sales volumes between these periods contributed to a $43.3 million positive impact, while a decrease in crude oil prices contributed a $162.6 million negative impact. For the year ended December 31, 2019 crude oil revenue also decreased by approximately $24.7 million due to the impact of our updated strategy to emphasize free cash flow in 2020 and beyond, resulting in a decrease in future capital expenditures and number of rigs, which decreased the future forecasted production and increased the forecasted deferral balance on one of our revenue contracts. Pursuant to ASC 606, the contract term impacts the amount of consideration that can be included in the transaction price, which reduced oil sales revenue.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, our crude oil sales averaged 42.3 MBbl/d. Our crude oil sales volumes increased 5% to 15,436 MBbl for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 14,679 MBbl for the year ended December 31, 2018. The volume increase was primarily due to an increase in production from the completion of 119 wells for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increased production from these new wells was partially offset by the natural decline of our existing producing properties.
The average price we realized on the sale of crude oil was $46.74 per Bbl for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $57.27 per Bbl for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to changes in market prices for crude oil and the $24.7 million decrease of crude oil revenue explained above.
Natural gas sales revenues. Natural gas sales revenues increased by $3.3 million to $108.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to natural gas sales revenues of $105.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. An increase in sales volumes between these periods contributed a $40.3 million positive impact, while a decrease in natural gas prices contributed a $37.0 million negative impact.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, our natural gas sales averaged 177.3 MMcf/d. Natural gas sales volumes increased by 38% to 64,710 MMcf for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 46,847 MMcf for the year ended December 31, 2018. The volume increase was primarily due to the completion of 119 gross wells for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increased production from these new wells was partially offset by the natural decline of our existing producing properties.
The average price we realized on the sale of our natural gas was $1.68 per Mcf for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $2.25 per Mcf for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to capacity constraints in transporting the wet gas associated with crude oil production coupled with negative market conditions surrounding limited export capacity.
NGL sales revenues. NGL sales revenues decreased by $39.3 million to $75.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to NGL sales revenues of $114.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. An increase in sales volumes between these periods contributed a $19.7 million positive impact, while a decrease in price contributed a $59.0 million neg",1
"ITEM 7 OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Introduction
The Company's business is Greenpower, which includes developing, constructing and operating Greenenergy production facilities, including those that utilize natural gas as fuel to produce thermal and electric power (""cogeneration"") or renewable energy projects primarily converting wind energy into transmittable electric power.
Within our Greenpower business, there are five currently operating facilities: in New York City, a 38 megawatt (""MW"") Warbasse cogeneration facility (the ""Warbasse facility"") and a 286MW Brooklyn Navy Yard cogeneration facility (the ""BNY facility""), in Big Spring, Texas, a 34MW wind energy facility (the ""Big Spring facility"") and a 6.6MW wind energy facility (the ""West Texas project"") and a 225 MW natural gas fueled power project in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago (the ""Trinidad project""). Other power projects are in earlier stages of development.
On March 2, 2000 North American Energy Conservation, Inc. (""NAEC""), an 85% owned subsidiary of the Company, filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. As of February 28, 2000, the Company accounted for NAEC's wholesale and retail natural gas marketing business as a discontinued operation, as well as the electric marketing business, which was discontinued previously. On April 20, 2000 NAEC sold its retail natural gas marketing business to Amerada Hess Corporation (see Note 17A).
Reference is made to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K dated March 2, 2000 for a complete description of the background and circumstances surrounding the NAEC filing.
See Note 3 for disclosure of the impact of significant new accounting pronouncements.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview
The Company finances initial development of a projects' cash needs from its own funds. When a project is determined to be feasible, the Company will generally seek to finance construction through some form of non-recourse project financing. Once a project is operational, any additional capital requirements are expected to be met by the operations of the facility. In addition, the Company may finance future projects through the sale of partial interests (or in some cases significant interests) or other financing techniques. For example, construction of the West Texas project was financed by a capital contribution of the limited partner in this project.
General corporate, pre-financing project development and negative working capital needs have historically been met by the cash flow derived from the power projects. The Company believes that from cash flow sources described above and from potential development fees received on future projects, there will be sufficient cash flow for continuing operations for at least twelve months. However, unless the Company is successful continuing in raising new funds as described below, there can be no assurance that it will have sufficient working capital to meet its obligations.
York has guaranteed approximately $46 million of the total pre-petition debt of NAEC. York and NAEC have conducted extensive discussions with both the guaranteed and non-guaranteed creditor groups and had arrived at a settlement agreement, which was approved by the bankruptcy court on January 8, 2001. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, among other requirements, the Company was required to fund $13 million into a trust for the benefit of the creditors by May 1, 2001. To date, both NAEC and the Company have been unable to fund the initial cash payment into the trust. The time for the Company to perform has been extended while it continues negotiations with the creditors. The trust is expected to be funded, upon formation, with a minimum of $13 million, six million shares of common stock which would be sold over time under controlled conditions to liquidate the obligations, a warrant for one million shares at an exercise price to be determined and a carried interest in the Company's net available cash flow, as defined, which will be used to the extent the sale of the common stock is insufficient to liquidate all obligations. To the extent the trust has not previously been liquidated, the total amount to be liquidated via the trust is expected to increase by $2 million on the third anniversary and additional amounts up to a cap of $4 million on each anniversary thereafter. Included in the total settlement is an expected debt obligation of $1 million, collateralized by certain assets, due December 31, 2009 or earlier under certain circumstances as defined.
York, with the help of Credit Suisse First Boston (""CSFB"") and other consultants, is pursuing several alternative means, including the potential sale of all or part of York's interest in various projects, of raising the funds necessary to fund the trust and meet its other ongoing obligations.
There can be no assurance that the trust referred to above being negotiated with the creditor groups will ultimately resolve NAEC'S liabilities or York's obligations with respect thereto. There also can be no assurance that the efforts of the Company to raise sufficient funds will be successful.
The Company has met all required principal and interest payments on the project notes payable to date, and expects to continue to do so. The project notes payable are non-recourse to York. However, as a result of the bond trustee's inability to set up certain foreign escrow accounts pursuant to provisions included in the bond indenture, the project notes payable have been classified as a current liability as of February 28, 2001 (see Note 11).
General
During fiscal 2001, cash and cash equivalents decreased approximately $5.1 million. Cash used in operating activities of continuing operations was approximately $3.4 million. This principally consisted of net income of approximately $3.8 million adjusted for non cash items of approximately $7 million less the increase in receivables and other assets of approximately $13.9 million.
During fiscal 2001, investing activities provided approximately $4.8 million. Net cash flow from the escrow accounts was approximately $9.1 million. The Company purchased approximately $4.7 million of property, plant and equipment utilizing cash received from the escrow accounts.
During fiscal 2001, financing activities used approximately $2.7 million due to payments on the project notes.
Results of Operations
Fiscal 2001 Compared to Fiscal 2000
Revenues include the sale of electric energy to utility customers by the Big Spring and Trinidad facilities. Revenues also include power project services such as engineering services, fuel procurement and other services. Cost of revenues include fuel, payroll, depreciation and other operations and maintenance costs. Revenues increased approximately $14,764,000 and cost of revenues increased approximately $11,570,000 when comparing fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2000. These increases are primarily the result of the commencement of operations of the Trinidad project in September 1999 and increased revenues and related costs of fuel of approximately $5,877,000 for the Warbasse facility.
The Big Spring project revenues increased approximately $322,000 and cost of revenues increased approximately $1,881,000 when comparing fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2000. These increases are primarily the result of full commercial operation being achieved in December 1999. Of the increase in cost of revenues, approximately $1,215,000 relates to depreciation. Depreciation commenced January 1, 2000.
The Trinidad project revenues increased approximately $9,710,000 and cost of revenues increased approximately $3,458,000 when comparing fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2000. These increases are due to the commencement of operations of the Trinidad Project in September 1999. Of the increase in cost of revenues, approximately $1,862,000 relates to depreciation. Depreciation commenced October 1, 1999. The Trinidad project has no fuel risk because the government provides all the fuel utilized by the project.
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased approximately $2,309,000, when comparing fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2000. This decrease is comprised of the following: (a) expenses incurred in developing power projects decreased approximately $557,000 and (b) general corporate expenses decreased approximately $1,752,000 as part of an overall effort to reduce costs. There was a decrease of approximately $649,000 in professional fees, $375,000 in accretion expenses on the Class B warrant redemption, $181,000 in advertising and public relations, and $153,000 in travel and entertainment. The balance of the decrease relates to various other costs.
Interest income decreased approximately $625,000 when comparing fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2000 due to decreased levels of cash available for investment resulting principally from payments on construction of the Trinidad and Big Spring projects. Interest income - WCTP increased approximately $534,000 due to increases in the variable interest rate charged.
Interest expense increased approximately $9,409,000 when comparing fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2000. The increase was primarily caused by the impact of capitalizing construction period interest of approximately $9,365,000 during fiscal 2000.
Other income increased approximately $3,503,000 when comparing fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2000. The change was primarily due to an increase in royalty fees from BNYLP of approximately $2,957,000 as a result of increased BNYLP revenues and a gain on sale of marketable securities of approximately $320,000.
Fiscal 2000 Compared to Fiscal 1999
Revenues include the sale of electric energy to utility customers in the case of the Big Spring and Trinidad projects. Revenues also include power project services such as engineering services, fuel procurement and other services. Cost of revenues include fuel, payroll, depreciation and other operations and maintenance costs. Revenue increased approximately $16,295,000, and cost of revenues increased approximately $4,811,000, when comparing fiscal 2000 to fiscal 1999, as a result of the commencement of the operations of Big Spring in December 1998, West Texas in June 1999 and Trinidad in September 1999.
The Big Spring project earned revenue of approximately $3,892,000 and $342,000 respectively, and incurred costs of approximately $920,000 and $70,000 respectively, for the years ended February 28, 2000 and 1999. For fiscal 2000, the Trinidad project earned revenues of approximately $9,296,000 and incurred costs of approximately $2,226,000 of which approximately $1,287,000 relates to depreciation. The Trinidad project has no fuel risk because the government provides all the fuel utilized by the project. The amount earned on construction of the West Texas facility (see Note 8C) also accounted for an increase in revenues of approximately $1,388,000 for the year ended February 28, 2000.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately $2,533,000, when comparing fiscal 2000 to fiscal 1999. This increase is comprised of the following: (a) expenses incurred developing power projects increased approximately $1,047,000. (b) general corporate expenses increased approximately $1,486,000. There was in increase of approximately $492,000 due to amortization of certain deferred charges related to the Portfolio Bond Financing. The balance of this increase primarily relates to professional and consulting fees and additional amounts spent on payroll and employee benefits as a result of additional personnel.
Interest income decreased approximately $1,238,000 when comparing fiscal 2000 to fiscal 1999, due to decreased levels of cash available for investment resulting principally from construction of the Trinidad and Big Spring projects.
Interest expense increased approximately $2,205,000 when comparing fiscal 2000 to fiscal 1999. The increase was caused by the full year impact of the Portfolio Bond Financing in fiscal 2000, net of interest capitalized on construction costs incurred.
Other income increased approximately $597,000 when comparing fiscal 2000 and fiscal 1999. These changes were primarily due to an increase in royalty fees from BNYLP of approximately $285,000 and an increase in general partner fees received from BNYLP of approximately $176,000.",1
"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
The following discussion and analysis should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the other financial data appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
Unless otherwise indicated, all dollar amounts in the following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations that exceed $1 million have been rounded to one decimal place and all dollar amounts less than $1 million have been rounded to the nearest thousand.
Executive Overview
In the fourth quarter of 2001,we developed a revised strategic plan, which focused on profitable revenue growth in our 25-state footprint. This plan served as the basis for our recapitalization with our principal shareholder, Forstmann Little & Co., lender group, and Preferred Shareholders, as well as the structuring of the Exit Facility and continues to serve as the basis of our yearly operating plans.
In order to execute our plan we initiated a variety of programs across the business to significantly improve the customer experience, eliminate unneeded infrastructure and cost, improve the quality of the network and grow the top line revenues. Over the past three years we have successfully executed nearly all of these programs. The operational and certain financial results of the Company, as reported in its quarterly and annual financial releases, reflect the significant progress that has been made in the operational areas.
However, the Company's revenues have not increased as forecasted and have been declining since 2002. The decline in revenue was driven primarily by our program to eliminate non-profitable customers, turnover of customers to competitors in excess of new customers acquired, reduction of long
distance minutes used by our customer base, reduction in access rates as mandated by the FCC, and lower prices for some of our products. We have taken significant actions to increase revenue, including introduction of new competitively priced products, reorganization of the sales operation into three distinct channels, hiring of experienced executive sales leadership, expanding the involvement of the board of directors and executive staff in the sales process and reducing customer churn. To date, these actions have not resulted in profitable new revenue growth which continues to be a challenge as we compete against large, financially strong competitors with well-known brands. With the recent merger announcements in the industry, we believe that the large telecommunications providers will likely become even more aggressive upon the closing of these transactions further challenging our ability to grow revenue.
In light of the inability of the Company to achieve new revenue growth in excess of existing customer turnover and ultimately generate enough operating cash flow to service the existing level of debt, our Board of Directors has authorized the Company to pursue strategic alternatives. In support of these initiatives, we have hired Miller Buckfire Ying & Co., LLC and Gleacher Partners, LLC as the Company's financial advisors. We are now actively pursuing a strategic partner or a sale of the Company while also taking steps to maintain future liquidity, including evaluating a capital restructuring to reduce the current debt level enabling the Company to achieve positive cash flow going forward.
We believe that the Company's operational excellence combined with a highly trained workforce, state of the art product offerings and expansive network could provide strategic benefits to existing multi-state and regional telecom services providers. In addition, through the extensive cost reduction programs, which have been implemented over the past several years, we believe the Company's wholesale product suite offers an attractive alternative to UNE-P providers for local access lines and competitive long distance services.
In the first quarter of 2004 we recognized that as a result of the continued decline in revenues, it would be necessary to obtain an amendment to certain restrictive covenants in the Company's Credit Facilities from its lender group. We sought and obtained approval of amendments from our lender group on April 30, 2004. Based on the expected timing of the realization of certain retail and wholesale revenue initiatives, we believed it was more likely than not that we would not meet the minimum revenue covenant as of December 31, 2004. On December 3, 2004, we entered into the Sixth Amendment to the Credit Agreement, and the Third Amendment to the Exit Facility. The Company paid approximately $2.8 million in fees to the lender group in connection with the approval of these amendments. Had we not obtained the April 2004 and December 2004 amendments we would have been in default of the revenue covenant but would have been in compliance with all other covenants.
We have undertaken numerous actions to conserve cash, including the reduction of capital expenditures and selling, general and administrative expenses (""SG&A""), as well as the execution of extensive cost reduction efforts initiated in late 2001 and continuing through 2004. In the second quarter of 2004 we implemented a revised business plan which incorporated additional actions focused on reducing SG&A expenses and conserving cash. In addition, we been selective in managing capital expenditures and do not believe that any of the reductions in capital spending will have a material impact on our ability to service our customers.
We ended December 31, 2004 with $50.0 million of cash on hand. Currently, we have used a total of $108 million, including outstanding letters of credit, against the Exit Facility. In light of our current level of cash and the upcoming required payments under the Credit Facilities, we have begun discussions with our agent bank and a group of lenders acting as a steering committee for the lenders under our Credit Facilities. The Company has entered a forbearance agreement with our lenders with respect to scheduled principal and interest payments on our loans whereby the lenders agree not to take any action as a result of non-payment by the Company of approximately $18.1 million of
scheduled principal amortization and interest payments due on or before March 31, 2005 and any related events of default through May 23, 2005. On March 22, 2005, we elected not to make $2.8 million of interest payments on such loans and, as a result, an event of default occurred and we are required to accrue an additional two percentage points of interest on such loans as provided in the forbearance agreement. We believe that by not making principal and interest payments on the Credit Facilities, cash on hand together with cash flows from operations is sufficient to maintain operations in the ordinary course without disruption of services.
In light of the revenue outlook and the Company's on-going cash requirements, we have also begun discussions related to a capital restructuring with our agent bank and a group of lenders acting as a steering committee for the lenders under our Credit Facilities. The Company and this committee are in negotiations related to terms of a capital restructuring which includes the conversion of a significant portion of the Company's current outstanding debt into equity. Under such a restructuring, the holders of our current debt would become equity shareholders of the Company with the current holders of the preferred and common stock unlikely to receive any recovery.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to reach an agreement with our lenders regarding a capital restructuring or continued forbearance and covenant relief prior to the end of the initial forbearance period on May 23, 2005. There also can be no assurance that we will be able to identify a suitable strategic partner or buyer or reach agreement with any such strategic partner or buyer on terms and conditions acceptable to us prior to the end of the initial forbearance period. In the event these alternatives are not available to the Company, it is likely that we will elect to forgo making future principal and interest payments to our lenders while we continue to seek an extended forbearance period or permanent capital restructuring from our lenders, or alternatively, the Company could be forced to seek protection from its creditors.
While we continue to explore a variety of options with a view toward maximizing value for all of our stakeholders, none of the options presented to date have suggested that there will be any meaningful recovery for the Company's current preferred stock or common stockholders. Accordingly, it is unlikely that holders of the Company's preferred stock or common stock will receive any recovery in a capital restructuring or other strategic transaction.
Our financial statements for the period ending December 31, 2004 are prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business, but we may not be able to continue as a going concern. The report of our independent registered public accounting firm accompanying our financial statements in this report on Form 10-K contains a comment stating that there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. In the event our restructuring activities are not successful and we are required to seek protection from our creditors, additional significant adjustments may be necessary in the carrying value of assets and liabilities, the revenues and expenses reported and the balance sheet classifications used.
Overview of Our Business
We derive our revenue from our core telecommunications and related communications services. These include local and long distance services; local data services such as dial-up and dedicated Internet access services, using DSL, cable modem and dedicated T1 access; integrated access services, which link voice and data lines together on one high-speed connection; conference calling services; wireless services; bandwidth and network facilities leasing, sales and services, including access services; facilities and services dedicated for a particular customer's use; advanced communications services for larger businesses such as frame relay, private line, and ISDN; and value-added services such as virtual private networks, hosted Exchange and shared web hosting.
As of December 31, 2004, we operated a network with 699 access nodes collocated in RBOC central offices. We serve our customers by using various loop/access UNEs provided by the RBOCs and
aggregating them through our access nodes. In turn, our access nodes are interconnected through approximately 39 service node locations where our switching/routing systems reside. In a metropolitan area, access node to service node connectivity is based either on our own fiber facilities or on UNE transport from the RBOCs. Our service nodes are located in most of the major metropolitan areas across our footprint. These service nodes are in turn interconnected by our high capacity, inter-city core network. The underlying transport for our core network is based either on our own fiber or on leased capacity from interexchange carriers.
To develop these networks, we have assembled a collection of metro and inter-city network assets in our 25-state footprint, substantially all of which we own or control, making us a facilities-based carrier. These network assets incorporate state-of-the-art fiber optic cable, dedicated wavelengths of transmission capacity on fiber optic networks and transmission equipment capable of carrying high volumes of data, voice, video and Internet traffic. We operate in a 25-state footprint, which consists of the following states:
Arizona
Indiana
Minnesota
North Dakota
Texas
Arkansas
Iowa
Missouri
Ohio
Utah
Colorado
Kansas
Montana
Oklahoma
Washington
Idaho
Louisiana
Nebraska
Oregon
Wisconsin
Illinois
Michigan

Basis of Presentation
During the period from January 31, 2002 to April 16, 2002, McLeodUSA operated as a debtor-in-possession. The consolidated financial statements during the period from January 31, 2002 to April 16, 2002, the effective date of the Plan, have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Position 90-7, Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization Under the Bankruptcy Code (""SOP 90-7""). We adopted the provisions of SOP 90-7 upon commencement of the Bankruptcy Court proceedings. The consolidated statement of operations for the period January 1, 2002 to April 16, 2002 separately discloses expenses related to the Chapter 11 proceedings as reorganization charges. Interest expense on all of the outstanding senior notes and the preferred stock dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock ceased to accrue after the filing of the voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 by McLeodUSA on January 31, 2002. Interest and dividends ceased by operation of law. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the emergence from bankruptcy.
Upon emergence from bankruptcy, we implemented fresh-start accounting under the provisions of SOP 90-7. Under SOP 90-7, the reorganization fair value of McLeodUSA was allocated to its assets and liabilities, its accumulated deficit was eliminated, and its new equity was issued according to the Plan as if it were a new reporting entity. We recorded a $1.5 billion reorganization charge to adjust the historical carrying value of our assets and liabilities to fair market value reflecting the allocation of McLeodUSA's $1.15 billion estimated reorganized equity value as of April 16, 2002. We also recorded a $2.4 billion gain on the cancellation of debt on April 16, 2002, pursuant to the Plan.
For the periods January 1, 2002 to April 16, 2002 and April 17, 2002 to December 31, 2002, the operating results of businesses sold have been reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (""SFAS"") No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets"" (""SFAS 144"").
As a consequence of the reorganization occurring as of April 16, 2002, the financial results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002 have been separately presented under the label ""Predecessor McLeodUSA"" for the period January 1, 2002 to April 16, 2002 and ""Reorganized McLeodUSA"" for the period April 17, 2002 to December 31, 2002. For discussion purposes below, the periods January 1,
to April 16, 2002 and April 17, 2002 to December 31, 2002 have been added together to compare to the year ended December 31, 2003.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Prior to August 2001, McLeodUSA grew rapidly by focusing on top-line revenue growth, which required significant capital for the construction of local and long distance voice networks and a national data network and included the acquisition of numerous businesses. By mid-2001, due to certain factors, including but not limited to complications related to our rapid growth and a general downturn in the economy and the telecommunications sector in particular, we were not meeting internal expectations in terms of profitability and cash flow.
Beginning in August of 2001, we initiated a new strategic plan that included a broad financial and operational restructuring. Our new strategy was to refocus our business to be a facilities-based communication services provider within our 25-state footprint, improve business discipline and processes and reduce our cost structure, all with the goal of profitably growing revenues and generating positive cash flow from operations. Key elements of the restructuring included abandonment of the national network plan, disposing of non-core businesses, reducing the employee base, consolidating facilities, reducing capital expenditures, and eliminating unprofitable services and unprofitable customers.
We initiated a variety of programs across the business to significantly improve the customer experience, eliminate unneeded infrastructure and cost, improve the quality of the network and grow the top line revenues. Over the past three years we have successfully executed nearly all of these programs. The operational and certain financial results of the Company, as reported in our quarterly and annual financial releases, reflect the significant progress that has been made in the operational areas.
As an independent communications services provider, realizing the revenue growth benefits of operational excellence continues to be a challenge for the Company as we compete against large, financially strong competitors with well-known brands. Most recently, the FCC has finalized its unbundling rules and the communications industry consolidation has accelerated. With the recent merger announcements in the industry, we believe that the large telecommunications providers will likely become even more aggressive upon the closing of these transactions further challenging our ability to grow revenue.
As discussed in the ""Executive Overview,"" we are pursuing strategic alternatives and are now actively pursuing a strategic partner or a sale of the Company while also taking steps to maintain future liquidity, including evaluating a capital restructuring to reduce the current debt level enabling the Company to achieve positive cash flow going forward.
Our financial statements for the period ending December 31, 2004 are prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business, but we may not be able to continue as a going concern. The report of our independent registered public accounting firm accompanying our financial statements in this report on Form 10-K contains a comment stating that there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. In the event our restructuring activities are not successful and we are required to seek protection from our creditors, additional significant adjustments may be necessary in the carrying value of assets and liabilities, the revenues and expenses reported and the balance sheet classifications used.
Background of Capital Structure and Credit Facilities
During 2001, in connection with our revised business strategy, we began to explore restructuring our capital structure. Any restructuring involving a payment to bondholders, other than regularly
scheduled payments of principal and interest, required a majority consent under our Credit Agreement. In order to effect a restructuring, we entered into the Third Amendment to the Credit Agreement. Under the Third Amendment, the lenders under the Credit Agreement waived: (1) any bankruptcy and payment cross-defaults with respect to the Notes arising from the restructuring; (2) covenants restricting the sales of assets in order to allow the sale of Pubco pursuant to the restructuring, and the use of the $600 million of proceeds therefrom to make a payment to the bondholders; and (3) certain other covenants and other provisions of the Credit Agreement that would have restricted our ability to enter into various transactions necessary to consummate the restructuring. The Third Amendment contained certain modifications that became effective upon our consummation of the Plan, including, among other things, the modification of various financial covenants and the addition of a capital expenditure limitation, a 1% increase in the applicable rates of interest on the borrowings under the Credit Agreement and the establishment of certain prepayment premiums applicable to the Credit Agreement term loan repayments made in the first three years following the restructuring.
As provided for in the Third Amendment to the Credit Agreement, we entered into the Exit Facility with a consortium of banks upon consummation of the Plan on April 16, 2002. The Exit Facility consists of a revolving credit facility of $110 million. The Exit Facility matures on May 31, 2007, with any outstanding amounts due on that date; no principal payments are due until this maturity date. The Exit Facility is secured by first priority liens on the assets of McLeodUSA and its domestic subsidiaries and ranks superior to the Credit Agreement.
We are required to pay a commitment fee on the average daily unused balance of the Exit Facility at an annual rate ranging from 1/2% to 1%. Funds borrowed under the Exit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to either (a) the greater of (1) the prime rate and (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 1/2%, in each case plus a margin ranging from 1.00% to 2.50%; or (b) LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 2.00% to 3.50%.
The Exit Facility and the Credit Agreement include restrictions as to, among other things, additional indebtedness, liens, sale and lease-back transactions, investments, asset sales, certain payments by restricted subsidiaries, capital expenditures and designation of unrestricted subsidiaries. The Exit Facility and the Credit Agreement also contain restrictive covenants that require minimum levels of interest coverage and EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facilities, as amended).
On April 30, 2004 we entered into the Fifth Amendment to the Credit Agreement and the Second Amendment to the Exit Facility. The approved amendments include changes to the minimum revenue, leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio covenants. The minimum revenue covenant was amended to $825 million, $780 million, $760 million, and $770 million in the first quarter through fourth quarter of 2004, respectively. The leverage ratio was replaced with a minimum cumulative EBITDA covenant (as defined in the Credit Facilities, as amended) of $8 million, $16 million, $24 million and $34 million for the first through fourth quarters of 2004, respectively, and a trailing four quarter minimum EBITDA of $49 million, $69 million, $89 million and $114 million for the first through fourth quarters of 2005, respectively. The interest coverage ratio was amended to 1.0x for each of the four quarters of 2004 and 1.0x, 1.5x, 2.0x and 2.0x for the first through fourth quarters of 2005, respectively. We paid approximately $1.9 million in fees in April 2004 to the lender group in connection with the approval of the Fifth Amendment to the Credit Agreement and the Second Amendment to the Exit Facility.
Based on the expected timing of the realization of certain retail and wholesale revenue initiatives, we believed it was more likely than not that we would not meet the minimum revenue covenant as of December 31, 2004. On December 3, 2004, McLeodUSA entered into the Sixth Amendment to the Credit Agreement and the Third Amendment to the Exit Facility. The trailing four-quarter minimum revenue covenants were amended to eliminate the minimum revenue covenant for the fourth quarter of 2004. The Company is not subject to a minimum revenue covenant for periods after the fourth quarter of 2004. In addition, the capital expenditure limits for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2005 and
were revised downward to $75 million and $150 million, respectively. We paid approximately $0.9 million in fees to the lender group in connection with the approval of these amendments. Currently, we have used a total of $108 million, including outstanding letters of credit, against the Exit Facility.
As previously discussed, we have begun discussions with our agent bank and a group of lenders acting as a steering committee for the lenders under our Credit Facilities. The Company has entered a forbearance agreement with its lenders with respect to scheduled principal and interest payments on its loans whereby the lenders agree not to take any action as a result of non-payment by the Company of approximately $18.1 million of scheduled principal amortization and interest payments due on or before March 31, 2005 and any related events of default through May 23, 2005. We believe that by not making principal and interest payments on the Credit Facilities, cash on hand together with cash flows from operations is sufficient to maintain operations in the ordinary course without disruption of services.
2004 Cash Flow
We ended December 31, 2004 with $50.0 million of cash and cash equivalents versus $56.5 million at December 31, 2003. This decrease of $6.5 million resulted primarily from the following:
The payments for restructuring liabilities primarily related to remaining lease payments and lease buyouts associated with facility exits made in 2001 and 2002 as part of our restructuring. The source of cash related to changes in assets and liabilities primarily related to a decrease in our trade accounts receivable and prepaid and other balances. We expect our cash requirements to pay restructuring liabilities to be approximately $11 million during 2005.
As discussed above, we have reduced our growth-related capital expenditure plan and expect to spend less than $45 million during 2005. The capital expenditure plan remains dedicated to new product introduction and strategic growth initiatives. Deferred line installation costs are the result of costs required to add customers onto our network. Our deferred line installation expenditures during 2005 will be dependent on the rate at which we add new customers.
Principal payments under the Credit Agreement of $27.0 million were made in 2004. During 2005, mandatory debt repayments under the Credit Agreement are scheduled to total $49.5 million.
Currently, we have used a total of $108 million, including outstanding letters of credit, against the Exit Facility. As discussed above, The Company has entered a forbearance agreement with its lenders with respect to scheduled principal and interest payments on its loans whereby the lenders agree not to take any action as a result of non-payment by the Company of approximately $18.1 million of scheduled principal amortization and interest payments due on or before March 31, 2005 and any related events of default through May 23, 2005.
Outlook for 2005 and Future Funding Needs
We ended December 31, 2004 with $50.0 million of cash on hand. In 2005, our cash requirements will consist of new products, important capital expenditure projects, remaining lease payments and lease buyouts associated with facility exits made in 2001 and 2002 (as part of our restructuring) as well as changes in working capital. A combination of cash on hand, cash generated from operating activities and the proceeds from the sale of fiber assets will be used to meet these ongoing cash requirements while we continue to pursue strategic alternatives and continue discussion with our lenders regarding a capital restructuring.
We have continued to take additional steps to conserve cash and improve liquidity. Actions that have been taken to generate further operational efficiencies and focused expense management resulted in approximately $8 million of quarterly SG&A run-rate savings by the fourth quarter of 2004. We have reduced our growth related capital expenditure plan and now expect to spend approximately $45 million in 2005. The capital expenditure plan for 2005 remains dedicated to new product introduction and strategic growth initiatives. As a result of the actions described above we have significantly reduced our cash usage in the third and fourth quarters of 2004 and expect to realize continuing benefits from these programs in 2005. We will continue to execute our cash management program while pursuing the strategic initiatives and capital restructuring discussions mentioned above.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to reach an agreement with our lenders regarding a capital restructuring or continued forbearance and covenant relief prior to the end of the initial forbearance period on May 23, 2005. There also can be no assurance that we will be able to identify a suitable strategic partner or buyer or reach agreement with any such strategic partner or buyer on terms and conditions acceptable to us prior to the end of the initial forbearance period. In the event these alternatives are not available to us, it is likely that we will elect to forgo making future principal and interest payments to our lenders while we continue to seek an extended forbearance period or permanent capital restructuring from our lenders, or alternatively, the Company could be forced to seek protection from its creditors.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
McLeodUSA has indemnification obligations to its current and former Directors and Officers. The terms of the indemnification obligations provide for no limitation to the maximum potential future payments under such indemnifications. McLeodUSA maintains insurance, subject to limitations set forth in the policies, which is intended to cover the costs of claims made against its Directors and Officers.
McLeodUSA entered into an executive employment agreement with its Chief Executive Officer, Chris A. Davis, as of October 14, 2004. Under the agreement, McLeodUSA has agreed to make equalization payments, as necessary, to offset any reduction in certain annual cash compensation currently received by Ms. Davis from Forstmann Little. The amount of such equalization payments is not to exceed $500,000 annually.
Contractual Obligations
The following table sets forth our contractual obligations to make future payments at December 31, 2004 (in millions):
The following shows our other contingent obligations at December 31, 2004 based on the expiration date of the commitment (in millions):
Results of Operations
The following comparisons are based on the financial information presented in Item 6. ""Selected Financial Data"" as well as the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.""
Year Ended 2004 Compared with Year Ended 2003
Revenue. Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2004 declined $152.8 million, or 18% to $716.2 million from $869.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The following table compares our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003:
Total revenues declined by $152.8 million versus the year ended December 31, 2003 due to a continued decline in total customers, FCC mandated reduction in access rates, and lower long distance rates. Approximately $38.7 million of the decrease in local revenues is attributed to a reduction in the number access lines in service due to customer turnover in excess of new lines sold. The decrease in long distance revenue is primarily attributed to a 27% drop in average rates from 2003. Rates have declined as a result of increased competition as well as a significant change in the mix of wholesale versus retail minutes. During 2004, wholesale minutes have increased 137% over 2003. Local and long distance average revenues per customer have decreased year over year as the Company has reduced the
cost of service and offered substantially more competitive pricing for these products. Access revenues have decreased $47.6 million from 2003 primarily due to the final FCC mandated rate reduction. Included in revenues from indefeasible rights of use in the above table is $5.6 million and $6.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, related to on-going revenues from operating leases.
The Company has taken significant actions to increase revenue including introduction of new competitively priced products, reorganization of the sales operation into three distinct channels, hiring of experienced executive leadership and expanding the involvement of the board of directors and executive staff in the sales process.
Cost of Service. Cost of service includes expenses directly associated with providing communication services to our customers. Costs classified as cost of service include, among other items, the cost of connecting customers to our network via leased facilities, the costs paid to third party providers for interconnect access and transport services, the costs of leasing components of our network facilities and the cost of fiber related to sales and leases of network facilities. Cost of service was $393.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, a decrease of $105.1 million or 21% from year ended December 31, 2003. Approximately $53 million of the decrease reflects the results of our ongoing network cost reduction efforts that began in 2002, including least cost routing, network optimization including grooms, migration of customers to the McLeodUSA network and elimination of non-profitable customers. The balance of the decrease is attributed to the reduct",1
"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
OVERVIEW
We are an integrated communications provider offering facilities-based voice and data telecommunications services primarily to small and medium-sized businesses in 29 second and third tier markets in 12 states in the northeastern and midwestern United States. In January 2004, we began offering residential voice and data telecommunication services in selected markets in our footprint. Our services include:
- local exchange and long distance service; and
- high-speed data and Internet services.
Our principal competitors are established telephone companies, such as the regional Bell operating companies, as well as other integrated communications providers.
We seek to become the leading integrated communications provider in each of our markets by offering a single source for competitively priced, high quality, customized telecommunications services. A key element of our strategy has been to be one of the first integrated communications providers to provide comprehensive network coverage in each of the markets we serve. We have achieved this market coverage by installing both voice and data equipment in multiple established telephone company central offices. As of December 31, 2003, we have connected approximately 94% of our clients directly to our own switches, which allows us to more efficiently route traffic, ensure a high quality of service and control costs.
Our financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Our auditors' opinion notes that we have suffered recurring losses from operations and have a net capital deficiency that raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
At December 31, 2003, we had $16.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and all available commitments under our senior credit facility were outstanding. We generated positive cash flows from operating activities during the final two fiscal quarters of 2003 and positive adjusted EBITDA during each of the fiscal quarters in 2003. Although not necessarily indicative of future results, the final two fiscal quarters of 2003 was the first time in our history that we generated positive cash flows from operating activities during reporting periods. Our viability is dependent upon our ability to continue to generate and grow positive cash flows from operating activities. The success of our business strategy necessitates obtaining and retaining a significant number of customers, generating significant and sustained growth in our cash flows from operating activities, and managing our costs and capital expenditures to be able to meet our debt service obligations, including the repayment of principal beginning on June 30, 2004.
Our senior credit facility contains certain covenants that are customary for credit facilities of this nature. These covenants require us to maintain an aggregate minimum amount of cash and committed financing of $10.0 million through June 30, 2004 and, commencing on September 30, 2004, require us to maintain certain leverage, fixed charges and interest coverage ratios as described in the senior credit facility. Our ability to comply with these covenants will primarily depend on our operating results, which are subject to the uncertainties described above. A breach in observance of any of these covenants, if unremedied in three business days, would cause an event of default under the senior credit facilities and an event of default under our subordinated debt. An event of default would permit our obligations under our senior credit facility and our subordinated debt to be declared to be immediately payable. If the lenders so accelerate our obligations, then we can make no assurances that we would be able to obtain additional or substitute financing. An acceleration of our obligations would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
As of December 31, 2003, and from then through the date of filing of this report, we were and are in compliance with all covenants under our senior credit facility. However, it is reasonably likely, without covenant relief or modification or other action, that we will be in breach of one or more applicable covenants at some point during 2004. With respect to this situation, we intend to pursue a variety of matters including changes to our operating plans to enable us to remain in compliance, discussions with lenders to gain certain waivers or modifications regarding our covenants which will enable us to remain in compliance, and other possible actions and strategic alternatives. To help guide and facilitate this effort, we have engaged consultants to provide us with a broad range of financial advisory services. We can make no assurances that we will be successful in any or all of these efforts.
The year ended December 31, 2003 was marked by several significant highlights that are discussed in further detail in our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. The year ended December 31, 2003 was also marked by our implementation of measures to become more efficient in providing our products and services, strengthen our cash position and become adjusted EBITDA positive. Our discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements for the three years ended December 31, 2003.
During 2003, we:
- Celebrated our 5th year of providing services in the competitive telecommunications industry;
- Were recognized by the New York State Public Service Commission (NYSPSC) for providing excellent telephone service to our customers during 2002;
- Continued with operational initiatives to optimize our network and lower our cost structure;
- Implemented initiatives to improve our credit and collections processes;
- Took steps to reduce selling, general and administrative expenses through cost reduction initiatives; and
- Reduced capital expenditures as we completed our network build out.
FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
REVENUE
We generate revenue from the following categories of service:
- - local calling services, which consist of monthly recurring charges for basic service, usage charges for local calls and service charges for features such as call waiting and call forwarding;
- - long distance services, which include a full range of retail long distance services, including traditional switched and dedicated long distance, 800/888 calling, international, calling card and operator services;
- - DSL and other data services, which consist primarily of monthly recurring charges for connections from the end-user to our facilities;
- - access charges, which we earn by connecting our clients to their selected long distance carrier for outbound calls or by delivering inbound long distance traffic to our local service clients;
- - reciprocal compensation, which entitles us to bill the established telephone companies and competitive local exchange carriers for calls in the same local calling area placed by their clients to our clients; and
- - web design and hosting.
The market for local and long distance services is well established. The principal ways to increase revenues from these services is to capture market share from other service providers and to increase the amount and range of services sold to existing clients. We expect revenue from access charges that are based on other established telephone companies' long distance calls made by and to our clients to increase in the aggregate as revenue increases, but on a declining per unit basis, as the FCC's benchmark for established interstate access rates declines. The FCC mandates that we reduce the rates we charge interexchange carriers for interstate switched access services to a level equal to the rate charged for similar services by competing established telephone companies. Such mandated rate reduction have occurred in prior years with the last step in the transition phase-down of access charges established by the FCC set to occur on June 21, 2004. As in prior years, we expect that growth in our non-access revenue will fully offset negative revenue impacts from this access rate decrease. Reciprocal compensation rates are also expected to decline on a per unit basis. However reciprocal compensation revenue is expected to increase as minutes of use volume increases.
The market for high-speed data communications services and Internet access is intensely competitive. We offer data services in all of our markets. We generate revenue from the sale of these services to end user clients in the small and medium-sized business market segments. We price our services competitively in relation to those of the
established telephone companies and offer bundled and individual services to give clients incentives to buy a portfolio of services. See ""Description of Business--Our Telecommunications Services.""
During the past several years, market prices for many telecommunications services on a unit basis have been declining, which is a trend that we believe will likely continue. This decline may have a negative effect on our revenue. Although pricing is an important part of our strategy, we believe that direct relationships with our clients and consistent, high quality service and client support is essential to generating client loyalty. See ""Description of Business - --Competition.""
Our churn rate for the year ended December 31, 2003 of our facilities-based business clients was approximately 1.5% per month, as compared to 1.6% per month for the year ended December 31, 2002. We seek to minimize churn by providing superior client care, by offering a competitively priced portfolio of local, long distance and Internet services, by signing a significant number of clients to multi-year service agreements, and by focusing on offering our own facilities-based services.
There is uncertainty surrounding the payment of reciprocal compensation by the established telephone companies for calls delivered to Internet service providers due to their regulatory interpretations and disputes therein. However, the amount of reciprocal compensation revenue that we receive related to Internet service providers is not material. See ""Description of Business - --Regulation --Federal Regulation.""
NETWORK COSTS
Our network costs include the following:
- - The cost of leasing high-capacity digital lines that interconnect our network with established telephone company networks. These facilities are also used to connect our switching equipment to our transmission equipment located in established telephone company central offices, as well as to connect our transmission equipment between these offices. These network expenses include non-recurring installation costs and monthly recurring fixed costs. As our markets mature, these costs will remain a significant part of our ongoing cost of services, but are expected to represent a declining percentage of total costs.
- - The cost of leasing our inter-city network. Our inter-city network facilities are used to carry data traffic between our markets and for delivery to Internet access points. The costs of these lines will increase as we increase capacity to address client demand. As we deploy fiber, however, these costs associated with the leased facilities will decrease and an increase in depreciation expense will occur due to the deployment of fiber.
- - The cost of leasing local loop lines which connect our clients to our network. The costs to lease local loop lines from established telephone companies vary by company and are regulated by state authorities under the Telecommunications Act. These client loop costs are for voice and data lines as well as client T-1 links. These expenses include non-recurring installation costs and monthly recurring fixed costs. As our clients and related lines continue to increase, total local loop line costs will continue to increase and will remain a significant component of our ongoing network costs.
- - The cost of leasing space in established telephone company central offices for collocating our transmission equipment. When we constructed switching and transmission equipment, we capitalized, as a component of property and equipment, non-recurring charges for items such as construction. We also capitalized the monthly recurring leasing costs of the collocations during the construction period, typically one to two months. These capitalized non-recurring costs are depreciated over the life of the lease and are not included in our network costs. After traffic is being carried on the facilities, recurring lease costs are expensed as incurred and are included in our network costs. As a market matures, these costs are expected to remain relatively constant, decreasing as a total component of total network costs.
- - The cost of completing local calls originated by our clients. These local call costs are referred to as ""reciprocal compensation"" costs and are incurred primarily in connection with voice services. We have entered into interconnection agreements with the established telephone companies in our markets to make widespread calling available to our clients. These agreements typically set the cost per minute to be charged by each party to the other for the calls that are exchanged between the two carriers' networks and provide that a carrier must compensate the other carrier when a local call by the first carrier's client terminates on the other carrier's network. These reciprocal compensation costs will grow as our clients' outbound calling volume grows and will continue to be a significant component of total network costs. As clients and related lines installed increase, our
costs will continue to increase proportionately. Changes in regulatory requirements for reciprocal compensation costs may result in an arrangement of bill and keep which may dramatically reduce these costs to us.
- - The cost of completing, originating (1+ calling) and terminating (inbound 800 calling) long distance calls by our clients. The cost of securing long distance service capacity is a variable cost that increases in direct relationship to increases in our client base and our clients' long distance calling volumes. These minute of usage charges will continue to be a significant component of total network costs. As clients and calling volumes increase, these costs will continue to increase proportionately.
SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES
Our selling, general and administrative expenses include costs associated with sales and marketing, client care, billing, corporate administration, personnel, and network maintenance. We incur other costs and expenses, including network maintenance costs, administrative overhead, office lease expense and bad debt expense.
NON-CASH DEFERRED COMPENSATION
As the estimated fair market value of our common stock exceeded the exercise price of certain options that we granted, we recognized non-cash deferred compensation that was amortized over the vesting period of the options.
As our estimated fair market value has exceeded the price at which shares of our stock have been sold to management employees since our formation, we recognized a non-cash deferred compensation charge of $4.4 million which was amortized over a four year period from the date the shares were issued. The charge was fully amortized at December 31, 2002. In addition, we have similarly recognized a non-cash deferred compensation charge of $7.5 million in connection with the issuance of options to various employees, which was amortized over a four-year period from the date the options were issued. The non-cash compensation charge was fully amortized at December 31, 2003.
MANAGEMENT OWNERSHIP ALLOCATION CHARGE
Upon consummation of our initial public offering, we were required by GAAP to record the $119.9 million increase in the assets of Choice One Communications L.L.C. allocated to management as an increase in additional paid-in capital, with a corresponding increase in deferred compensation. We were required to record $62.4 million of the deferred compensation as a non-cash, non-recurring charge to operating expense during the period in which the initial public offering was consummated, and the remaining $57.5 million was recorded as deferred management ownership allocation charge. The allocation charge was fully amortized at December 31, 2002.
RESTRUCTURING (CREDITS)/COSTS
During September 2002, we identified opportunities to optimize the use of capital and company assets and committed to a plan of workforce reductions, closing operations in our Ann Arbor and Lansing, Michigan market and reducing reliance on certain collocation sites. On September 5, 2002, we announced that we had reduced our workforce by 102 operational and administrative positions. In addition, approximately 100 positions were eliminated through normal attrition.
On October 9, 2002, we notified our customers in the communities of Ann Arbor and Lansing, Michigan that we would be ceasing operations in that market. We stopped selling services to new clients in this market and notified existing customers of the decision and the approximate time remaining until services were terminated. We also redeployed certain equipment from this market to other markets to optimize our network assets and to minimize future capital expenditures. Revenue and operating results of the Ann Arbor and Lansing, Michigan market were not significant to our consolidated results of operations. This market was closed in December 2002 and had an immaterial impact on revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002.
We recorded restructuring costs of $5.3 million in September 2002, comprised of employee termination benefits of $0.6 million, contractual lease obligations of $3.4 million and network facility costs of $1.3 million. During February 2003, we modified a portion of our restructuring plan related to reduced reliance on certain collocation sites. As we engaged in our restructuring actions in the first quarter of 2003, we were informed that additional costs would be charged to us by the established telephone companies in connection with the restructuring. Based on this new information, we reduced the number of collocation sites that would be affected.
DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION
Our depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of switch related equipment, non-recurring charges and equipment collocated in established telephone company central offices, network infrastructure equipment, information systems, furniture and fixtures, and indefeasible rights to use fiber. It also includes amortization of goodwill (prior to January 1, 2002) and client relationships. We performed an assessment of our goodwill impairment during June 2002 in accordance with SFAS No. 142 ""Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets"" and determined that the goodwill was fully impaired.
Our acquisitions of US Xchange, Atlantic Connections and EdgeNet were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The value of the client relationships acquired from US Xchange, Atlantic Connections and EdgeNet was $48.5 million, $3.3 million and $0.5 million, respectively, and is being amortized over five year periods. The value of the indefeasible right to use fiber acquired from US Xchange was $34.3 million and is being amortized over 20 years. The amount of the purchase price in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired (goodwill) for US Xchange, Atlantic Connections and EdgeNet was $319.3 million, $7.3 million and $3.5 million, respectively. The goodwill had been amortized over the estimated useful life of 10 years. Amortization of the goodwill ceased as of January 1, 2002, in accordance with SFAS No. 142.
INTEREST INCOME (EXPENSE)
Our interest income results from the investment of our cash and other short-term investments. Our interest expense includes interest payments on borrowings under our senior credit facility, non-cash interest expense on the subordinated notes, amortization of deferred financing costs related to these facilities, amortization of the discount on the subordinated notes and Term C loan under the senior credit facility, interest expense related to IRUs, and commitment fees on the unused senior credit facility. As of July 1, 2003, dividends and accretion related to our Series A preferred stock were also classified as interest expense. Dividends on preferred stock may be paid in-kind or in cash, at our option. Interest expense on the subordinated notes is payable in-kind (PIK) through November 2006. Interest expense, currently payable in cash, as discussed below, is the interest expense that must be settled periodically in cash as compared to the interest expense which accretes to principal.
INCOME TAXES
We have not generated any taxable income to date and do not expect to generate taxable income in the next few years. The use of our net operating loss carryforwards, which begin to expire in 2021, may be subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. We have recorded a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset, consisting primarily of net operating loss carryforwards, due to the uncertainty of its realizability.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, management evaluates these estimates.
Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. We believe our most critical accounting policies, judgments and estimates include those relating to revenue recognition, the allowance for doubtful accounts, network costs and long-lived assets.
Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Revenue recognition. Revenue from monthly recurring charges, enhanced features and usage is recognized in the period in which service is provided in accordance with GAAP and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, ""Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements"" (SAB 104). Deferred revenue represents advance billings for services not yet provided. Such revenue is deferred and recognized in the period in which service is provided. Nonrefundable activation fees are also deferred and recognized as revenue over the expected term of the customer relationship. The Company recognizes revenue from switched access and reciprocal compensation based on actual usage and applicable rates per minute of usage, adjusted for management's assessment of reasonable collectibility. As part of the revenue recognition process for switched access, we evaluate whether receivables are reasonably assured of collection based on certain factors, including past credit history, financial condition of the customer,
industry norms, past payment history of the customer and the likelihood of billings being disputed by customers. In situations where a dispute is likely, we generally defer recognition until cash is collected. Certain judgments in measuring revenue and assessing the reasonable assurance of collectibility, including regulatory interpretations and legal challenges, may affect our results. Revenue results may be difficult to predict, and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly and could result in future operating losses.
Allowance for doubtful accounts. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make the required payments. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required resulting in additional expense to us and affecting our results of operations. In addition, collectibility may be affected by regulatory and contractual challenges.
Network costs. The liability for network costs is incurred to provide telecommunication services to our clients and is recognized in the period when the service is utilized. There is considerable judgment and estimation of these costs based on line and circuit counts, estimated usage, active collocation sites, contractual interpretations and anticipated challenges, and regulatory interpretations and anticipated changes. In addition, we accrue for charges invoiced by carriers which are probable for payment but have not been paid due to rate or volume disputes. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, our accrued network costs were $19.4 million and $33.9 million, respectively. Changes in these estimates could have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Long-Lived assets. Our business acquisitions resulted in goodwill and other intangible assets that affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we may incur. During 2002, we determined that our goodwill was fully impaired. We also have a significant investment in property and equipment. The determination of the value and any subsequent impairment of our remaining long-lived assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that may affect our consolidated financial statements. Long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. The impairment loss, if determined to be necessary, would be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Factors that may affect the recoverability of our long-lived assets include shifts or reductions in our client base, adverse changes in our expected future cash flows and changes in our borrowing amounts and market interest rates.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND DECEMBER 31, 2002
REVENUE
We generated $322.9 million in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of 11.0% as compared to $290.8 million in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002. Of our total revenue increase, approximately $32.4 million was attributable to increases in voice and data revenue, offset by a $0.3 million decrease in access revenues. The favorable changes in voice and data revenue were primarily due to increases in the average number lines in service during 2003. The average number of lines in service increased by approximately 60,700 lines. Our lines in service at December 31, 2003 increased approximately 3.0% from our lines in service at December 31, 2002.
Average revenue per line in 2003 as compared to 2002 declined by approximately 2.0% as compared to 2.8% a year ago. Our access revenue was negatively impacted by reduced interstate rates that we charged other carriers as FCC mandated rate reductions took effect in both June 2002 and June 2003. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, we provided service in 29 markets, and had a total of 515,715 and 500,923 lines in service, respectively. Revenue is expected to increase from the level realized during the year ended December 31, 2003 due to the full year impact of 515,715 lines in service, additional penetration in our existing markets, the introduction and sales of additional value added services to our existing clients and the introduction of residential services in selected markets in 2004.
NETWORK COSTS
Network costs for the year ended December 31, 2003 were $157.7 million, a decrease of $6.1 million, or 3.8%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease is partly due to a reduction in the number of collocation sites operated during 2003. The number of operational collocation sites as of December 31, 2003 was
505, as compared to 530 operational collocation sites as of December 31, 2002. The reduction in collocation sites was a direct result of our restructuring activities previously described above.
Additionally, initiatives to further optimize our existing network implemented during 2002 continued during 2003. These initiatives included least cost routing, replacing leased capacity with alternative technologies and grooming and capacity sizing of our network facilities. As a result, for 2003 our average cost per line declined approximately 15% as compared to 2002, highlighting the effectiveness of our network optimization initiatives, economies of scale, and the benefits of leasing fiber. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we took possession of fiber in one additional market in our footprint from Fibertech, LLC, under our master facilities agreement, bringing to 19 the number of markets where we have intra-city fiber capacity connecting our collocations. We plan to activate fiber in an additional 3 markets across our footprint in 2004. Amortization of the cost of the capital leases for fiber is included in depreciation and amortization expense. As a result of the factors noted above, we expect that network costs as a percentage of revenue will decline in 2004.
Our revenues exceeded our network costs by $165.2 million, or 51.1% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to $126.9 million, or 43.6% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2002. We continue to evaluate network optimization initiatives. We expect that our revenue in excess of network costs, as a percentage of revenue will improve as our revenue increases and as we are able to capitalize on network optimization initiatives and economies of scale.
SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003 were $129.9 million, compared to $173.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Excluding the non-cash deferred compensation and management ownership allocation charges, the selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $28.6 million, or 18.2%, from $157.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 to $129.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Selling, general and administrative expenses are expected to grow as we serve our increasing client base and introduce new services to our clients, but are expected to be at a consistent percentage of our revenue.
Selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding non-cash deferred compensation and management ownership allocation charges, as a percentage of revenue was 39.9% for 2003 as compared to 54.2% for 2002. The changes in selling, general and administrative expenses resulted primarily from reductions in the number of sales employees, and a decrease in bad debt expense. During this period, salary, commissions and benefits decreased approximately $13.1 million related to a decrease in the average annual headcount of approximately 373 employees, mainly in the sales force. The reduction of personnel in the sales force was generally through attrition of non-productive employees, and is not expected to have an adverse effect on revenue. At December 31, 2003, we employed 1,412 individuals, of whom 567 were involved in sales, sales management and sales support. As of December 31, 2002, there were 1,529 employees, of whom 656 were involved in sales, sales management and sales support.
Bad debt expense decreased by $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from the year ended December 31, 2002. We increased our bad debt reserves during the year ended December 31, 2002 for accounts receivable affected by the economic conditions present at that time. This included accounts related to telecommunications carrier accounts, including Global Crossing and WorldCom, now known as MCI.
Also included in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003, is non-cash compensation expense of $1.0 million. This compares to non-cash charges of $16.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, which includes management ownership allocation amortization of $10.",1
